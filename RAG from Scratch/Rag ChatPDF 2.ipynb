We take pride in our employees as well as in the products and services we provide.\\nThe Company complies with all federal and state employment laws, and this handbook generally reflects those laws. The\\nCompany also complies with any applicable local laws, although there may not be an express written policy regarding those\\nlaws contained in the handbook. \\nThe employment policies and/or benefits summaries in this handbook are written for all employees. When questions arise\\nconcerning the interpretation of these policies as they relate to employees who are covered by a collective-bargaining\\nagreement, the answers will be determined by reference to the actual union contract, rather than the summaries contained in\\nthis handbook.\\nPlease take the time now to read this handbook carefully. Sign the acknowledgment at the end to show that you have read,\\nunderstood, and agree to the contents of this handbook, which sets out the basic rules and guidelines concerning your\\nemployment. This handbook supersedes any previously issued handbooks or policy statements dealing with the subjects\\ndiscussed herein. The Company reserves the right to interpret, modify, or supplement the provisions of this handbook at any\\ntime. Neither this handbook nor any other communication by a management representative or other, whether oral or written,\\nis intended in any way to create a contract of employment. Please understand that no employee handbook can address\\nevery situation in the work place. \\nIf you have questions about your employment or any provisions in this handbook, contact People Operations.\\nWe wish you success in your employment here at Zania, Inc.!\\nAll the best,\\nShruti Gupta, CEO\\nZania, Inc.\\n1.2 \\nAt-Will Employment\\nYour employment with Zania, Inc. is on an \"at-will\" basis. This means your employment may be terminated at any time, with\\nor without notice and with or without cause. Likewise, we respect your right to leave the Company at any time, with or\\nwithout notice and with or without cause. \\nNothing in this handbook or any other Company document should be understood as creating a contract, guaranteed or\\ncontinued employment, a right to termination only \"for cause,\" or any other guarantee of continued benefits or employment.\\nOnly the CEO has the authority to make promises or negotiate with regard to guaranteed or continued employment, and any\\nsuch promises are only effective if placed in writing and signed by the CEO.\\nIf a written contract between you and the Company is inconsistent with this handbook, the written contract is controlling. \\nNothing in this handbook will be interpreted, applied, or enforced to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the\\nexercise of their rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.\\n4This policy may not be appropriate in its entirety for employees working in Montana.\\n2.0 \\nIntroductory Language and Policies\\n2.1 \\nAbout the Company\\n[[Add your about the company statement here.]]\\n2.2 \\nCompany Facilities\\n[[Insert information about your company facilities here.]]\\n2.3 \\nEthics Code\\nZania, Inc. will conduct business honestly and ethically wherever operations are maintained.

The degree of\\ndiscipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the\\nviolator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.\\n2.4 \\nMission Statement\\n[[Insert your company\\'s mission statement here.]]\\n2.5 \\nOur Organization\\n[[Add information about your organization or organizational chart here.]]\\n2.6 \\nRevisions to Handbook\\nThis handbook is our attempt to keep you informed of the terms and conditions of your employment, including Zania, Inc.\\npolicies and procedures.

Completion of this\\nintroductory period does not imply guaranteed or continued employment. Nothing that occurs during or after this period\\nshould be construed to change the nature of the [[\"at-will\"]] employment relationship.\\n3.7 \\nTraining Program\\nIn most cases, and for most departments, training employees is done on an individual basis by the department manager.\\nEven if you have had previous experience in the specified functions of your job duties, it is necessary for you to learn our\\nspecific procedures, as well as the responsibilities of the specific position. If you ever feel you require additional training,\\nconsult your Manager.\\n4.0 \\nWage and Hour Policies\\n4.1 \\nAttendance\\nIf you know ahead of time that you will be absent or late, provide reasonable advance notice to your Manager.

Travel between your home and primary office is not considered to be\\nbusiness travel. You may not use your personal vehicle for business travel without authorization. Every attempt should be\\nmade to utilize the use of courier and delivery services in order to avoid hazard of liability and the time away from work. You\\nwill be reimbursed for vehicle use at the standard IRS mileage rate.

Credit card purchases related to Company vehicle use (gas, oil, etc.) under\\n$100 do not require prior approval. Credit card purchases for vehicle use over $100 and any other business purchases over\\n$25 must receive prior approval from your Manager.\\nSubmit all sales receipts generated by use of the Company credit card [[weekly/monthly]] to your Manager [[or appropriate\\ndepartment]].

You\\nmust reimburse any such purchase to the Company within [[#]] days.\\nImmediately report lost or stolen Company cards to your Manager. Failure to follow this policy may result in disciplinary\\naction up to and including discharge.\\n5.0 \\nPerformance, Discipline, Layoff, and Termination\\n5.1 \\nCriminal Activity/Arrests\\nZania, Inc. will report all criminal activity in accordance with applicable law. Involvement in criminal activity while employed\\nby the Company, whether on or off Company property, may result in disciplinary action including suspension or termination\\nof employment. \\nYou are expected to be on the job, ready to work, when scheduled. Inability to report to work as scheduled may lead to\\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for violation of an attendance policy or job abandonment.\\n5.2 \\nDisciplinary Process\\nViolation of Zania, Inc.\\'s policies or procedures may result in disciplinary action, including demotion, transfer, leave without\\npay, or termination of employment. The Company encourages a system of progressive discipline depending on the type of\\nprohibited conduct. However, the Company is not required to engage in progressive discipline and may discipline or\\nterminate employees who violate the rules of conduct, or where the quality or value of their work fails to meet expectations at\\n11any time. Again, any attempt at progressive discipline does not imply that your employment is anything other than on an \"at-\\nwill\" basis consistent with applicable law. Note that the specific terms of your employment relationship, including termination\\nprocedures, are governed by the laws of the state in which you are employed.\\nIn appropriate circumstances, management will first provide you with a verbal warning, then with one or more written\\nwarnings, and if the conduct is not sufficiently altered, eventual demotion, transfer, forced leave, or termination of\\nemployment. Your Manager will make every effort possible to allow you to respond to any disciplinary action taken.\\nUnderstand that while the Company is concerned with consistent enforcement of our policies, we are not obligated to follow\\nany disciplinary or grievance procedure and, depending on the circumstances, you may be disciplined or terminated without\\nany prior warning or procedure.\\n5.3 \\nExit Interview\\nYou may be asked to participate in an exit interview when you leave Zania, Inc.. The purpose of the exit interview is to\\nprovide management with greater insight into your decision to leave employment; identify any trends requiring attention or\\nopportunities for improvement; and to assist the Company in developing effective recruitment and retention strategies. Your\\ncooperation in the exit interview process is appreciated.\\n5.4 \\nOpen Door/Conflict Resolution Process\\nZania, Inc. strives to provide a comfortable, productive, legal, and ethical work environment. To this end, we want you to\\nbring any problems, concerns, or grievances you have about the work place to the attention of your Manager and, if\\nnecessary, to Human Resources or upper level management. To help manage conflict resolution we have instituted the\\nfollowing problem solving procedure:\\nIf you believe there is inappropriate conduct or activity on the part of the Company, management, its employees, vendors,\\ncustomers, or any other persons or entities related to the Company, bring your concerns to the attention of your Manager at\\na time and place that will allow the person to properly listen to your concern. Most problems can be resolved informally\\nthrough dialogue between you and your immediate Manager. If you have already brought this matter to the attention of your\\nManager before and do not believe you have received a sufficient response, or if you believe that person is the source of the\\nproblem, present your concerns to Human Resources or upper level management. Describe the problem, those persons\\ninvolved in the problem, efforts you have made to resolve the problem, and any suggested solution you may have.\\n5.5 \\nOutside Employment\\nOutside employment that creates a conflict of interest or that affects the quality or value of your work performance or\\navailability at Zania, Inc. is prohibited. The Company recognizes that you may seek additional employment during off hours,\\nbut in all cases expects that any outside employment will not affect your attendance, job performance, productivity, work\\nhours, or scheduling, or would otherwise adversely affect your ability to effectively perform your duties or in any way create a\\nconflict of interest. Any outside employment that will conflict with your duties and obligations to the Company should be\\nreported to your Manager.
