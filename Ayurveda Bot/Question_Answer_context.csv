Because uric acid is the end product of protein metabolism, it is important to avoid high-protein diet. Sleeping during the day, exposure to heat, and excessive exercising should be avoided.10.5 Spasmodic Torticollis, Lockjaw (Hanu-Stambha), Lumbago (Kati Shula),  and Fibromyalgia 10.5.1 General Description Vitiated vata is the cause for torticollis (Manya-stambha), lockjaw (Hanu-stambha), and lumbago (kati shula). When the vitiated vata invades the neck muscles it causes muscle rigidity and immobility of the neck and pain in the neck muscles. Similarly, when it invades jaw muscles and joints, it causes lockjaw. When it invades the lower part of the back it causes lumbago, and when it invades all body muscles it causes ﬁbromyalgia (Sarvang shula). Pain and stiffness of the muscles are the main features of these diseases. lar or nervous energy. Vata’s task in the body is to ensure there is enough space for the air to move in and sufficient move- ment in that space. Air can move freely throughthe body only when its paths are free from obstacles.Spasm and phlegm for example can obstruct theflow of air through the lungs as in asthma. If thereis too much empty space and insufficient move-ment it can cause stasis, as in emphysema and constipation.

AKapha person is advised not to slow down digestion by sleeping or being inactive immedi-ately after eating as it increases Kapha. Pitta people should avoid heat-producing mental or physicalactivity when digestion is in full swing, as this canirritate Pitta. Vata people should stay calm and rest during digestion, otherwise high Vata will inhibit proper nutrition of rasa. Treating the dosha is the first consideration since any disturbance of the doshas eventually leads to ill health.

1, What is the role of ashwagandha in Vata treatment?, Ashwagandha is used in Ayurveda to balance Vata by providing nourishment and calming the nervous system.," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 83?","Respiratory system Due to its immune-enhancing properties andantimicrobial activity ashwagandha is used to increase resistance to respiratory infections. It isalso used in the treatment of allergies, rhinitis andasthma due to aggravated Vata. Genitourinary system Ashwagandha is the best regulator of Apana Vata, which governs the lower abdomen. It is excellentfor urinary problems, dysmenorrhoea and a variety damage caused by free radicals, thereby helping torestrain the ageing process. Internal uses Nervous system Ashwagandha is also an exceptional nerve tonic and one of the best remedies for stress. It is the best herbfor balancing Vata in the body. Along with herbs such as ginseng, liquorice and Astragalus it is classi- fied as an adaptogen, helping to modify the harm-ful effects of stress on mind and body. Ashwagandha is considered Sattvic in quality, which means it has a highly beneficial effect on mind and body, engen-dering calmness and clarity of mind, and helping topromote wisdom. With its significant calming andyet strengthening effects, it is excellent for peoplerun down by chronic illness and those sufferingfrom stress, anxiety, overwork, panic attacks, ner-vous exhaustion and insomnia. It is also well worthusing for children with behavioural problems andADHD. As a painkiller and anti-inflammatory it isused for inflammatory joint problems and can becombined with turmeric. for weakness and emaciation in children and the elderly and for a wide range of problems associated with old age, such as loss of energy, lack of muscular strength, poormemory, weak eyes, rheumatism, and insomnia.Ashwagandha has antioxidant properties limiting Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been shown to have a measurable effect on the immunesystem. It is classified as an adaptogen, helping to modify the harmful effects of stress, both phy-sical and mental. Known as Indian ginseng, ash-wagandha is an effective antioxidant and has atraditional use as a rejuvenative after illness and asan energy and nerve tonic. Research has shownthat ashwagandha protects the immune systemfrom the effects of toxic chemicals (Ziauddin et al1996). This immune-protecting property has beenresearched for its ability to reduce the side effectsof radiation and chemotherapy in the treatment ofcancer. One of the classic uses of ashwagandha isto calm mental turbulence and as a brain tonic.

Malas can themselves be damaged by excess doshas and dhatus, which inhibit their eliminative functions, and become sites of disease. If malas are not released they accumulate and affect surround-ing tissues. Excess faeces cause abdominal pain,distension, constipation, headache, indigestion anddullness. Excess urine causes bladder pain, irrit-able bladder, water retention and thirst. Excesssweat causes unpleasant body odour and oozing skin disease. Often excess Pitta is involved with skin disease like urticaria, eczema, boils and fun-gal infections. Excess sweating particularly in Vata people can cause dehydration, and fatigue. PREVENTATIVE HEALTH AND  TREATMENT According to Ayurveda, the key to health lies inthe understanding of one’s basic constitution,(prakruti) and how to keep it in balance through diet ●Turmeric, shilajit, pomegranate ( Punica grana- tum), amalaki, varuna (Crataeva nurvala) andguduchi can also provide relief. ●Tillotson quotes a clinical trial in India usingvaruna (Crataeva nurvala).

The next consideration in Ayurvedic treatment is the state of the digestive fire ( agni) (which is dis- cussed in full in the Digestive System (p. 193)). The therapeutic value of sesame oil Sesame oil is one of the most important tools of catarrh, lethargy, overweight and fluid retention,not to mention a tendency to possessiveness, greed,obstinacy and laziness. A diet consisting of warm,dry, light foods, which reduce Kapha would be advised and avoidance of foods with a cold, dampquality such as wheat, milk products and sugar,which would increase Kapha , would be recom- mended. Regular vigorous exercise would be sug-gested, as well as avoidance of getting up late andtaking naps in the day. Activities to stimulate themind and body would best suit Kapha types who otherwise might be rather unmotivated and pas-sive. Herbal remedies would include warmingspices like ginger, cinnamon, cloves and pepper toraise “digestive fire” and cleanse toxins from thebody. Bitters such as turmeric and aloe vera mayalso be prescribed. The specific choice of herbal rem-edy depends on its “quality” or “energy” whichAyurveda determines according to 20 attributessuch as hot, cold, wet, dry, heavy or light, and thesearise from the three gunas . results. In severe cases, medicated oil enema (anuvasana basti) is very beneﬁcial (e.g., sesame oil and dashamoola kwatha).8 Internally, ashokarishtam and A. vera in combination with some other drugs are used in Ayurvedic practice. For vata and pitta symptoms, shatavari (asparagus), ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), amalaki (Indian gooseberry), and yashtimadhu (licorice) work very well. To reduce kapha symptoms such as heaviness of breasts and ﬂuid retention, herbs such as triphala, trikatu (pepper, ginger, and long pepper), and vacha (Acorus calamus) are very useful. Jeerakadyarishtom, manasamitra vatakam, saras- watarishtam, shatavari kalpa, and kumaryasavam are some of the effective herbal formulas.10,14 In conventional medicine, a deﬁnite treatment has not yet emerged as a deﬁnition, and the etiology of the disease is unclear.

References Some of the most significant immune enhancers that are used by modern herbalists include echi-nacea (Echinacea angustifolia), golden seal ( Hydrastis canadensis), liquorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra), garlic (Allium sativum), guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) andastragalus (Astragalus membranaceus).

However, these substances share several limitations. One of their major drawbacks is the necessity to administer them parenterally, which often leads to local reactions such as granuloma formation. Another factor is the cost of therapy, which can be prohibitive. Against this background, the potential of Ayurvedic therapy appears to be encouraging.12 Ayurveda emphasizes the promotion of health with a concept of strengthening host defense against diseases.

5, What is the role of digestive fire (Agni) in Ayurveda?," Digestive fire, or Agni, is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and converting them into energy. Weak Agni leads to digestive issues and toxin accumulation."," Lakshmi C. Mishra - Scientific Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies, p. 308?","helps in digestion of food. Samana Vayu controls peristaltic movements and absorption of food.Apana Vayu controls defecation and expulsion of gases. Thirteen forms of Agni Jatharagni This is the digestive fire which imparts energy toall the secretions and enzymes in the process ofdigestion and resides in the stomach and smallintestine. It is not simply responsible for digestingand absorbing nutrients from food but also fordestroying pathogenic micro-organisms in the gut.If the digestive fire is low and digestion incom-plete as a result, partially digested or undigestedfood ferments and breeds toxins in the gut, therebycompromising the immune system. There are four different conditions of agni: 1.Variable (Vishama) 2.High (Tikshna) 3.Low (Manda) 4.Balanced ( Sama). Vishamagni Digestive fire tends to be variable in Vata types with their fluctuating nature and nervous diges-tion. It is caused by over heavy/light diet andactivities which increase Vata and in turn it causes given to children through their diet to maintain the health of the digestive tract. Agni can also be main- tained by regular exercise, yoga, deep breathing(pranyama), meditation, and proper eating. Ill health develops as a result of either excess, deficient or abnormal agni, which all eventually become low digestive fire. Weak agni lowers immunity as ama is formed from poor digestion and obstructs the channels ( srotas) throughout the body. The undigested food mass: Ama If digestive fire is low it leaves a residue of undi-gested or partly digested food that can accumu-late, stagnate and ferment. This is known as ama,from the root “ am”, to harm or weaken. Its forma- tion and accumulation is said to be the beginningof the disease process for all diseases. It weakensthe defence system and lowers resistance to dis-eases starting from the common cold. Hence agni is the key to health. Agni is increased by pungent, sour and salty Ayurvedic detoxification and “rejuvenation” is the primary approach to maintaining positivehealth. Detoxification of the body and “rejuven-ation” (nourishment of the tissues) are not confinedonly to treatment of disease but also to enhancingresistance. To understand the cause and treatment of this accumulation of toxins and its subsequent dam-age, from an Ayurvedic perspective, it is import-ant to clarify the concepts of agni and ama. Agni or digestive fire transforms and metabolizes nourish-ment from the environment. When agni is strong this nourishment is digested into its fundamentalfive elements and then these are absorbed eventu-ally to become our cells and tissues (see dhatus,  p. 75). When healthy, any of the digested food thatis not useful to the body is eliminated via the threepathways of elimination (malas): urine, faeces andsweat (see malas, p. 76). When agni is not functioning properly, toxins is the key to health. Agni is increased by pungent, sour and salty tastes and a small amount of bitter taste. Early tri-als demonstrated that the bitter taste stimulatedgastric secretion though only when the herb wastasted. Later trials on a patient with an occludedoesophagus and a gastric fissure found that bothsalivation and gastric secretion increased in linewith each other (Mills and Bone 2000). As anexample of the gastric-stimulating effect of pun-gent tastes, a double blind trial on human volun-teers found that black and red pepper significantlyincreased parietal and pepsin secretion (Myers et al 1987). To raise digestive fire: Agni deepana Spices are the best thing for increasing agni. Theygenerally have the same qualities as agni, being hot, dry, light and fragrant. Popular remedies for raising digestive fire include: ●Trikatu (ginger, long pepper and black pepper) ●Trikulu (clove, cinnamon, cardamom) ●Pippali ●Ginger"
6, How does Ayurveda classify diarrhea?," Ayurveda classifies diarrhea into Vata, Pitta, and Kapha types, with specific treatments for each type involving herbs and dietary recommendations."," Lakshmi C. Mishra - Scientific Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies, p. 374?","376 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 4. Diarrhea with severe malnutrition (marasmus or kwashiorkor) — The main dangers of this type of diarrhea are severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure, and vitamin and mineral deﬁciency. The management of each type of diarrhea should prevent or treat the main cause that each one presents.2 Diagnostic tests to ﬁnd the cause of diarrhea include the following: 1. Medical history and physical examination 2. Stool culture to determine the bacterial infection 3. Blood tests 4. Fasting tests 5. Sigmoidoscopy 6. Colonoscopy (similar to sigmoidoscopy, but the doctor looks at the entire colon) 21.1.8 Clinical Course and Prognosis According to Ayurveda, diarrhea is difﬁcult to cure if the stool is purple (ripe jamun fruit) or liver brown; amount of stool elimination is small; the consistency resembles dehydrated butter (ghee), oil, fat, or meat soup; embedded with shiny particles; and has a very ﬁshy Diarrhea (Atisara) and Dysentery (Pravahika) 373 21.1.3 Clinical Description Clinical features of different types of diarrhea are listed in Table 21.1. The major clinical features of diarrhea are increased ﬂuidity in stools, increased frequency of bowel move- ment, and increased stool volume. Although diarrhea is not considered a disease or disorder on its own in conventional medicine, Ayurvedic literature records it as both a symptom and an independent disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnes diarrhea as the passage of loose or watery stools, at least thrice in a 24-h period. However, it is the consistency of the stools rather than the frequency that is most important. Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhea.2 21.1.4 History and Epidemiology Diarrhea dates back to history of human life. According to Indian mythology, the disease was said to exist in the ﬁrst age (sathya yuga) and was observed to be the outcome of abnormal food habits and emotional disturbance.3 The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about four times a year. Diarrhea is called atisara in Ayurveda. Frequent passing of watery stools is the cardinal feature. According to Ayurveda, diarrhea results from the excess mass of stools and endotoxins (ama) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and this excess is eliminated through the nearest outlet (rectum) as diarrhea. Digestive and excretory systems, the two parts of the GI tract called mahasrotas, inﬂuence each other. The common etiological factors in the diseases of these systems are dyspepsia and endotoxin.1 21.1.2 Deﬁnition Atisara in Sanskrit means frequent passing of excessively watery, unformed stool. Other descriptions include watery stools, frequent bowel movements, and loose bowel move- ments.© 2004 by CRC Press LLC 378 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies A few compound formulations used in the treatment of enterotoxic diarrhea are given below: 21.1.9.2 Nonenterotoxic Diarrhea This condition is treated with carminatives and antimotility herbs.

A light diet and regular lifestyle changes are also recommended."," Lakshmi C. Mishra - Scientific Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies, p. 313?","314 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 1. In endotoxic indigestion, digestive drugs have to be used. If there is excess kapha, then vamana (emesis) is done under a physician’s supervision followed by diges- tive drugs such as panchakola curna, agnitudi vati, and rasonadi vati (Table 17.1). 2. Acid indigestion is treated with light and easily digestible food. If there is excess pitta, virecana (purgation) is followed by using antacids, such as sankha vati (Table 17.1). 3. To control vata in static indigestion, virecana with castor oil or Terminalia chebula is used followed by basti (enema) treatment done under medical supervision. To relieve constipation and indigestion, compound herbal powders such as bhaskara- lavana curna and hingvastaka curna are used (Table 17.1). 4.

Whole wheat bread, whole cereals, and rice (harvested and stored for a long time) are also helpful. To avoid indigestion, adhere to the following guidelines: 1. Eat meals at regular times. 2. Do not rush meals. 3. Enjoy eating and drinking, but do so in moderation. 4. Avoid those foods that are associated with symptoms. 5. Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If possible, consult a doc- tor before doing so. 6. Avoid stressful situations that cause emotional upset. 7. Stop smoking.8 17.11.4 Review of Ayurvedic Therapies The provision of dosage information in this section does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement but rather indicates the range of doses commonly used in Ayurvedic practice. Doses are given for single herb use and must be adjusted when using herbs in combinations.

Decreased state of enzyme (mandagni) — In this condition, simple meals are difﬁcult to digest and there is an uneasy feeling of indigestion. Other symptoms are malaise and vomiting.17.9 Classiﬁcation of Indigestion Ayurvedic literatures describe a total of six types of indigestion, of which three are pathological types. They are static indigestion (vishtabdha ajirna), acid indigestion (vidagdha ajirna), and endotoxic indigestion (ama ajirna). The other three are transient indigestion (rasasesha ajirna), diurnal indigestion (dinapaki ajirna), and successive indi- gestion (prativasara ajirna). Although the latter three are not pathological types, they are transitional and occur physiologically in between any two meals every day. Dislike for food intake until the earlier food is digested is known as transient indigestion. The feeling of abdominal heaviness and lethargy soon after food ingestion is a natural process"

However, these substances share several limitations. One of their major drawbacks is the necessity to administer them parenterally, which often leads to local reactions such as granuloma formation. Another factor is the cost of therapy, which can be prohibitive. Against this background, the potential of Ayurvedic therapy appears to be encouraging.12 Ayurveda emphasizes the promotion of health with a concept of strengthening host defense against diseases.

What, then, are these rasayana drugs that have so many vital life-enhancing properties? The ancient writers of Ayurveda have endowed the drugs with multiple properties of delaying aging, improving mental functions, and giving freedom from several diseases including those caused by infections. How can these rasayanas, which otherwise seem to be simple herbs having a different number of phytochemicals, inﬂuence such a wide variety of body functions?

Although the genetic makeup of an individual determines the basic body constitution with respect to dosas (biomaterials) and psychological factors, total health is determined by physical and psychological envi- ronment. It is currently believed that the expression of genes largely depends on environ- mental factors. Consistent with this belief, Ayurveda emphasizes the role of environmental factors, daily routine, seasonal changes, lifestyle, diet, regular exercise, and body tonics (rasayana) in maintaining health. It also emphasizes that all needs of the body and senses must be in balance in order to avoid illness and maintain good health — a scientiﬁcally disease. Kamya rasayana is further classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Pranakamya rasayana (promoter of life vitality and longevity); (2) Medhakamya rasayana (promoter of intellect); and (3) Srikamya rasayana (promoter of skin complexion and luster). Ayurvedic physicians should be consulted to determine the appropriate rasayana required depending upon the health needs. Rasayanas are the Ayurvedic equivalent to modern dietary supplements. It is under- standable that vitamins, minerals, and biologically active steroids, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, and a variety of antioxidants present in rasayanas would be a good source in providing necessary nutrients to the body. Sometimes an overdose of pure vitamins in modern dietary supplements can cause serious side effects. There is virtually no possibility of an overdose of any speciﬁc vitamin or mineral from a rasayana. 2.5.6  Formulas The drug treatment in Ayurveda primarily consists of herbal formulas, bhasmas, rasas (rasayana) in maintaining health. It also emphasizes that all needs of the body and senses must be in balance in order to avoid illness and maintain good health — a scientiﬁcally valid concept.1© 2004 by CRC Press LLC"

This facilitates smooth passage of stools and a sense of complete evacuation. Along with oil, ghee (clariﬁed butter), milk, and some roughage (i.e., green leafy vegetables) should be included in the diet. If the staple diet consists of bread, boiled vegetables, vegetable or animal protein, salad or dry foodstuffs, the content of ghee in the diet should be increased. Paradoxical as this may sound, ghee in measured quantities does not increase bad cholesterol.11 Ayurveda has instead attributed ghee to many useful effects, including the lubrication of blood vessels, which delays aging. One should pursue the habit of drinking milk before sleeping and add 1 tsp of ghee to it or use ghee with hot water; this is very beneﬁcial in mild to moderate constipation. Administering a laxative will lubricate the walls and help elimi- nation for the constipated patient and provides symptomatic relief at best.

Avoid trans fats as much as possible; this includes products that have hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats such as monoglycerides and diglycerides.GheeClarified butter, also known as ghee, is butter with the milk solids removed. Ghee is a digestive aid that improves the absorption of nutrients from food it’s used with. It also is known to improve memory, lubricate the connective tissues, and act as a catalytic agent to carry the medicinal properties of herbs to the body. Ghee calms both Pitta and Vata, but should be used sparingly by Kapha and those who have high cholesterol or suffer from obesity, and should not be used when you want to detoxify (i.e. when you are on a cleanse). 224 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies medications and modern medicine may be able to improve the control of this common respiratory disorder.13.10  Areas of Research  Further research is needed to: 1. Establish efﬁcacy of various Ayurvedic preparations used in asthma by good quality randomized controlled trials. 2. Determine the active principles in various Ayurvedic medications. 3. Evaluate the impact of Ayurvedic medications on the natural history. 4. Evaluate the role of immunomodulator medications available in Ayurveda.13.11  Conclusions The review of literature highlights need for more research in utility of Ayurvedic prepa- rations in bronchial asthma. At present, the medications and the management are not well standardized. As a large number of experimental studies have documented the presence of anti-inﬂammatory properties in various Ayurvedic preparations, there is potential for discovering new compounds useful in the management of asthma.References 210 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies13.1 Introduction Bronchial asthma is a common global health problem. Individuals of all ages are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and occasionally fatal. The prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide, especially in children.1 Over the past few decades, there have been signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances leading to improved understanding of the disease and better management. However, the current modes of therapy in conventional medicine do not cure the disorder but control the symptomatology. There is a need to explore safe alternative therapies, such as Ayurvedic medicine, so that they can be successfully integrated with conventional therapy to provide maximal beneﬁts to patients.13.2 Deﬁnition Ayurveda: Svasa (increased or difﬁcult breathing, dyspnea) refers to the disorders of the respiratory system. There are ﬁve kinds: ksudraka, tamaka, chchinna, mahan, and urdhava. Of these, tamaka svasa refers to asthma.2–5"

If your agni is treated correctly with proper food choices and portions, its fire should easily consume or “digest” the food, giving you constant energy and a balanced feeling, sustaining you until your next meal. In this chapter, you will find both traditional Indian recipes as well as some with  a modern fusion bent. Our bodies are most familiar with foods we eat in our own particular “culture,” so when you introduce new foods into your diet, start slowly to allow your body to assimilate them. Remember, your body speaks to you, telling you what it needs; listen to it. There are many simple, easy recipes here that can be prepared in under 30 minutes with a minimum of ingredients, as long as you are equipped with the basic Indian spices (see page 2 1).This chapter begins with the essential three elements of a nutritious and balanced Ayurvedic meal. First are The third stage is ruled by Vata and takes place in the large intestine and involves the formation ofstools. Here the air and ether elements are extractedfrom foods. Eating too much light, dry, astringent,bitter or pungent foods will increase Vata and give rise to symptoms such as wind, bloating, abdominalpain and constipation.

In endotoxic indigestion, digestive drugs have to be used. If there is excess kapha, then vamana (emesis) is done under a physician’s supervision followed by diges- tive drugs such as panchakola curna, agnitudi vati, and rasonadi vati (Table 17.1). 2. Acid indigestion is treated with light and easily digestible food. If there is excess pitta, virecana (purgation) is followed by using antacids, such as sankha vati (Table 17.1). 3. To control vata in static indigestion, virecana with castor oil or Terminalia chebula is used followed by basti (enema) treatment done under medical supervision. To relieve constipation and indigestion, compound herbal powders such as bhaskara- lavana curna and hingvastaka curna are used (Table 17.1). 4. In any stage of indigestion, ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), asafetida (Ferula foetida), and rock salt are used as digestives and carminatives.6 Treatment of IBS/colitis: Grahani When treating grahani the diet needs to be light and easy to digest. Heavy, indigestible foods suchas bread, cheese, red meat, cold, raw foods shouldbe avoided. Generally herbs to improve digestivefire, i.e. digestives and appetizers such as gingerand bilva are used to treat grahani. Vasant Lad(Lad 1999) recommends 1 tsp of psyllium huskand  1–2cup of yoghurt 1 hour after the evening meal, or 1 tsp of flax seed boiled in 1 cup of waterand drunk at bedtime.

Thus, rasayana refers to compound preparations containing mul- tiple herbs and minerals that improve transportation of nutritional materials to body tissues. The fundamental underlying theme of rasayanas is nutrition. They are part of the overall balanced diet. Rasayanas are claimed to improve vitality, rejuvenate body tissues, improve immunity, and prevent aging. Rasayanas may act in a variety of ways by improv- ing the nutritional value of the food, digestion and absorption of nutrients, transportation disease.

Basically, rasayanas are classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Ajasrika rasayana (nutrition, dietary) is taken regularly with food as nutrition; (2) Kamya rasayana (normal health promoter) is indicated to improve vigor, vitality, and to make a healthy person feel better; and (3) Naimittika rasayana is indicated to promote vitality in a particular disease. Kamya rasayana is further classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Pranakamya rasayana (promoter of life vitality and longevity); (2) Medhakamya rasayana (promoter of intellect); constitutes an important approach to handle with subjects of immunity. The objective of research on rasayana should focus not only on its immunomodulatory activity, but also on other effects such as antistress, antiaging, antioxidant, adaptogenic, and anti-HIV . The list of herbs in rasayana is exhaustive by itself. Rasayana formulas provide tremendous poten- tial to be tapped for immunomodulatory activity. It is equally important to arrive at a consensus in regards to the utilization of herbs in a holistic manner in order to deliver their multidimensional beneﬁts to mankind.© 2004 by CRC Press LLC"

Identify and remove food intolerances — A trained practitioner can supervise an elimination diet. Many foods are removed from the diet for a brief period and then reintroduced sequentially to isolate the body’s reaction to the offend- ing foods. Because grains are a common culprit, it is important to remember that carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth and that chewing grains thor- oughly allows amylase, the digestive enzyme present in saliva, to digest the grains. 2. Improve gut motility — Soluble ﬁber increases bowel transit, stools, and relieves constipation. Wheat bran has been used in some research studies, but it is not recommended for people who may have intolerances to wheat. Psyllium is a good source of soluble ﬁber and is readily available.

It has a deﬁned diag- nostic system covering all physiological functions and organs, as well as speciﬁc treatments and management techniques for each disease. Although Ayurveda is thousands of years old, many of its core principles are consistent with modern medicine. Ayurvedic medicine offers a wealth of relatively effective, safe, and economic health-care therapies.

Traditionally respected as a digestive aid, itscooling properties are effective in relievinginflammatory conditions, soothing irritated tis-sues and curbing diarrhoea and IBS. Modernresearch has borne this out and demonstrated itsability to soothe heartburn and indigestion(Dalvi et al 1990). Shatavari also enhancesimmunity and has been shown to improvemacrophage activity in response to Candida albi- cans (Rege and Dahanukar 1993).

22, How does Ayurveda classify the six tastes (Rasa)?," Ayurveda classifies the six tastes as sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. Each taste affects the doshas differently, balancing or aggravating them."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 153?","The six tastes Ayurveda classifies foods and herbs according to six tastes, sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter andastringent. Like the doshas, the six tastes are derived from the five great elements (Box 6.1). Infact each substance in nature is composed of allfive elements although one or two may predom-inate. So when we experience a food as sour forexample, it means it is mainly sour but containsother secondary tastes. Understanding the effectsof each taste on mind and body and the balance ofVata, Pitta and Kapha, means that foods and herbs can be more specifically chosen according to theneeds of the individual child. This classification canmake them more effective tools for prevention andtreatment of imbalance and disease, and has beenof enormous value to me in formulating prescrip-tions and giving dietary advice in my practice. Rasa is the Sanskrit word which means both The Six Essential Tastes of Ayurveda Ayurveda divides food into six tastes that influence the three doshas and thereby influence our overall sense of satiation and well-being. The six tastes are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent; each one affects our doshas differently. (Many foods have a combination of two or three tastes, such as oranges, which are considered both sweet and sour.) Ayurveda recommends that all six tastes be included in each meal; when they are, we will be left feeling harmonious, peaceful, and calm, as each dosha has been nourished. Note that only a little of each taste is necessary for it to satisfy and balance us; more is not necessarily better, and in fact, in certain situations it can be detrimental or toxic.The guidelines offered here will teach you how to harmonize your doshas, and bring yourself back into balance when necessary. Although it is important to have the six tastes at every meal, don’t become overly concerned with this, as it should be a goal, not a rule. As you learn fire. Those of sattva are like ether.

Diarrhea is called atisara in Ayurveda. Frequent passing of watery stools is the cardinal feature. According to Ayurveda, diarrhea results from the excess mass of stools and endotoxins (ama) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and this excess is eliminated through the nearest outlet (rectum) as diarrhea. Digestive and excretory systems, the two parts of the GI tract called mahasrotas, inﬂuence each other. The common etiological factors in the diseases of these systems are dyspepsia and endotoxin.1 21.1.2 Deﬁnition Atisara in Sanskrit means frequent passing of excessively watery, unformed stool.

Thus, rasayana refers to compound preparations containing mul- tiple herbs and minerals that improve transportation of nutritional materials to body tissues. The fundamental underlying theme of rasayanas is nutrition. They are part of the overall balanced diet. Rasayanas are claimed to improve vitality, rejuvenate body tissues, improve immunity, and prevent aging. Rasayanas may act in a variety of ways by improv- ing the nutritional value of the food, digestion and absorption of nutrients, transportation disease. Kamya rasayana is further classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Pranakamya rasayana (promoter of life vitality and longevity); (2) Medhakamya rasayana (promoter of intellect); and (3) Srikamya rasayana (promoter of skin complexion and luster). Ayurvedic physicians should be consulted to determine the appropriate rasayana required depending upon the health needs. Rasayanas are the Ayurvedic equivalent to modern dietary supplements. It is under- standable that vitamins, minerals, and biologically active steroids, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, and a variety of antioxidants present in rasayanas would be a good source in providing necessary nutrients to the body. Sometimes an overdose of pure vitamins in modern dietary supplements can cause serious side effects. There is virtually no possibility of an overdose of any speciﬁc vitamin or mineral from a rasayana. 2.5.6  Formulas The drug treatment in Ayurveda primarily consists of herbal formulas, bhasmas, rasas of the aging process. Indian medicinal plants offer prospects for the modulation of the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. The potential of several medicinal plants described in Ayurveda needs to be tapped.5.3 Immunomodulation and Concept Rasayana in Ayurveda Out of the eight branches of Ayurveda, the rasayana and vajeekarana tantra branch is the one that is concerned with the immunomodulation. According to Ayurveda, the common cause of all diseases may be due to contact with environmental factors and aging. The latter is inevitable and the other cause can be avoided only by scrupulously puritan patterns of living. Ayurveda claims to be able to slow down the process of aging success- fully. Rasayana is a treatment in which the body constituents are prepared to adapt to a selective tissue endowment program. This concept in modern scientiﬁc understanding would mean the enhancement of immune responsiveness of an organism against patho- good intellect, the ability to remain young, and general well-being. 5.3.1 Mode of Action of Rasayanas Rasayana drugs act on the immune system. On ingesting the appropriate formulation of the rasayana in the appropriate season by a qualiﬁed Ayuravedic physician, the beneﬁcial effects of rasayana are seen. What, then, are these rasayana drugs that have so many vital life-enhancing properties? The ancient writers of Ayurveda have endowed the drugs with multiple properties of delaying aging, improving mental functions, and giving freedom from several diseases including those caused by infections. How can these rasayanas, which otherwise seem to be simple herbs having a different number of phytochemicals, inﬂuence such a wide variety of body functions? To the scientiﬁc mind, it appears impossible to credit one plant with such an apparently disparate variety of effects — almost as though it were a magic potion! It seemed possible only if the drugs were modulating an endog-"

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity. Optimum functioning of the digestive tract both groups demonstrated a decrease in totalserum cholesterol levels (Jacob et al 1988). Otherstudies have indicated that amalaki may reduce the risk of blood clots by reducing stickiness ofplatelets (Sharma et al 1989). Respiratory system Amalaki has an antibiotic activity against a wide range of bacteria, and is used traditionally in treat-ment of lung infections (Chopra and Simon 2000).It is also used in asthma.

Sometimes the abdomen is distended. Severe symptoms include having a high fever, being very thirsty and having a red tongue; the abdomen may appear sunken in some cases, straining ceases, and the bowels become relaxed and may prolapse. The passage of urine is infrequent and is accompanied by a burning sensation. The pulse becomes slow, breathing becomes rapid, and generally, the patient looks pale and emaciated. This condition should not be allowed to continue.1 21.2.4 History and Epidemiology Man has known dysentery in its severe form since ancient times, but most cases acquired in the developed world today are mild. The earliest literature in Ayurveda describes this 386 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies Some authors of Ayurvedic literature consider this disease as an advanced stage of kapha diarrhea as well as enterotoxic diarrhea.3 Others consider it an individual disease.4 21.2.2 Deﬁnition In Ayurvedic medicine pravahika is the term used to indicate dysentery, which means moving with force. It is synonymous with visramsa, antargranthi, annagranthi, niscaraka, or nissaraka. Dysentery is an acute disease in which the stools and mucus secretion causes a delay in evacuation due to kapha and vata dosas resulting in straining down the stools.1 The word dysentery is derived from the Greek dusenteria, meaning bad intestine. 21.2.3 Clinical Description Passage of stool with mucus and tenesmus and a feeling of incomplete evacuation char- acterize the disease.1 Dysentery is a disease in which the patient passes a small quantity of mucoid, slimy, or bloodstained stool with considerable tenesmus, gripping abdominal Man has known dysentery in its severe form since ancient times, but most cases acquired in the developed world today are mild. The earliest literature in Ayurveda describes this disease in the chapter on diarrhea, whereas the latest authors have recorded this disease as an individual entity. Shigella infection has caused epidemics of dysentery throughout the world. It caused a 4-year epidemic in Central America beginning in 1968 that resulted in more than 500,000 cases and at least 20,000 deaths.44 21.2.5 Etiology Accoring to Ayurveda, the main causes for this disease are similar to diarrhea. These causes especially include foods that are incompatible (Ahita), extremely spicy, and heavy to digest (e.g., protein-rich foods). Drinking contaminated water is also another important cause.1 In conventional medicine, bacterial or viral infection, infestation of protozoa or parasitic worms, and chemical irritants are described as major causes of the disease. Some of these 388 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies used in the early stages of dysentery because of the presence of enterotoxin. In such conditions, mild laxatives are recommended. Using herbal formulas to improve digestion and produce a carminative effect is preferred to achieve a long-lasting effect. The bark of kurchi (Holaarhena antidysenterica) and the raw, tender fruit pulp of bael (Aegle marmelos) are the most important herbal ingredients in dysentery. Bastard saffron (Mesua ferrea) ﬂower bud, lodh bark (Symplocos racemosa), and silk cotton-tree resin (Bombax malabarica) are the styptic plants to be used. All prescriptions for diarrhea are also useful for dysentery.12 Among speciﬁc herbal remedies, bael fruit is, perhaps, the most efﬁcacious in the treatment of dysentery of both the varieties.

ARI in Ayurveda is described as intolerance developed in the body due to a variety of unwanted toxic mate- rials generated inside the body; this intolerance is either caused by poor digestion of food materials, inadequate metabolism of nutrients (ama-visa), or exposure to environmental pollutants (dushi-visa). Ayurvedic etiology of ARI is related to a decrease in immunity or vyadhiksamatva (resis- tance to diseases) that protects a person from diseases. Immunity is recognized as natural as well as acquired. This resistance is associated with or due to a biological material present in my own practice as a herbalist almost 15 yearsago.

For example, pure mercury salts do not account for the antiarthritic The science and art of bhasmas, a separate branch of pharmacy known as Rasa Shastra, is 2.5.5  Rasayana The word rasayana is made up of two Sanskrit words, rasa (nutrition) and ayana (trans- portation in the body). Thus, rasayana refers to compound preparations containing mul- tiple herbs and minerals that improve transportation of nutritional materials to body tissues. The fundamental underlying theme of rasayanas is nutrition. They are part of the overall balanced diet. Rasayanas are claimed to improve vitality, rejuvenate body tissues, improve immunity, and prevent aging. Rasayanas may act in a variety of ways by improv- ing the nutritional value of the food, digestion and absorption of nutrients, transportation good intellect, the ability to remain young, and general well-being. 5.3.1 Mode of Action of Rasayanas Rasayana drugs act on the immune system. On ingesting the appropriate formulation of the rasayana in the appropriate season by a qualiﬁed Ayuravedic physician, the beneﬁcial effects of rasayana are seen. What, then, are these rasayana drugs that have so many vital life-enhancing properties? The ancient writers of Ayurveda have endowed the drugs with multiple properties of delaying aging, improving mental functions, and giving freedom from several diseases including those caused by infections. How can these rasayanas, which otherwise seem to be simple herbs having a different number of phytochemicals, inﬂuence such a wide variety of body functions? To the scientiﬁc mind, it appears impossible to credit one plant with such an apparently disparate variety of effects — almost as though it were a magic potion! It seemed possible only if the drugs were modulating an endog- improve immunity, and prevent aging. Rasayanas may act in a variety of ways by improv- ing the nutritional value of the food, digestion and absorption of nutrients, transportation of nutrients to tissues, bioavailability of nutrients, metabolism of nutrients in tissues, immunity, and by cleaning the srotas (microcirculatory channels or pores) which improve uptake of micronutrients. Basically, rasayanas are classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Ajasrika rasayana (nutrition, dietary) is taken regularly with food as nutrition; (2) Kamya rasayana (normal health promoter) is indicated to improve vigor, vitality, and to make a healthy person feel better; and (3) Naimittika rasayana is indicated to promote vitality in a particular disease. Kamya rasayana is further classiﬁed into three categories: (1) Pranakamya rasayana (promoter of life vitality and longevity); (2) Medhakamya rasayana (promoter of intellect);"

37, What are the common causes of Pitta aggravation in children?," Pitta aggravation in children can be caused by exposure to heat, consuming spicy or sour foods, and emotional factors like anger or frustration."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 83?","Pitta children are quite methodical and organ- ized. They can be rather obsessive about time andtend to be perfectionists. They often wake up andgo to sleep at the same time every day. They sleepwell unless they are worried about something suchas schoolwork, or an exam the next day. They arehighly competitive and their main fear is fear of fail-ure. Pitta type children are naturally intelligent and quite fiery. They can be domineering, critical, self-critical, intolerant and do not suffer fools gladly. Hot weather, getting overheated by, for example vigorous exercise, hot spicy food and red meats, canall increase Pitta. When Pitta is high it can cause a feeling of increased internal heat, fever and inflam-mation. Children with an excess of Pitta are likely to insomnia, restless sleep, tension and anxiety, mental agitation, restlessness. Symptoms are worse at dawnor dusk and between 2–6 am and pm. Symptoms arebetter in warm weather and aggravated by cold. Signs of Pitta aggravation Inflammation in stomach and intestines causingheartburn and acidity, inflammatory skin problems(such as eczema and boils), eye problems such asconjunctivitis and blepharitis, heat and burning symptoms, tonsillitis, bronchitis, increased appetite,hypoglycaemia, profuse sweat, yellow discoloration(of the eyes, skin, nails, teeth and urine), fevers,hepatitis, appendicitis, cystitis, dizziness, irritability,anger, aggression, arrogance, perfectionism, overcompetitiveness, insomnia. Symptoms are worsein heat and between 10–2 am and pm and better incool weather. Signs of Kapha aggravation asthma is associated with Pitta and involves fever and infection and tends to improve with cooldrinks, cool foods and cool air. Specific dosha symptoms ●Vata: dry cough, wheezing, dry skin, thirst, con-stipation, anxiety, the child desires warm liquids.Attacks happen mainly at dawn or dusk. ●Pitta: wheezing, coughing with yellow phlegm,sweating, irritability, fever, the child desires coldair. Attacks occur mainly at noon or midnight. ●Kapha: wheezing and coughing with excessclear or white phlegm, rattling chest sounds.Attacks occur mainly in morning and evening. Pathogenesis (Samprapti) Low digestive fire causes accumulation of ama and affects Kapha in the chest area causing Sama Kapha and creating congestion. Prana and Udana Vayu become aggravated by high Vata diet, etc., leading to dryness, and constriction in the bronchi and bron-chioles, in the channels that carry Prana in the body. There is no place for Prana to go down and Udana to go up. Constipation disturbs Apana Vayu which Causes include drinking excessive amounts ofwater, excess consumption of pungent, dry, fatty,hard, cold or unaccustomed foods, eating before thelast meal is digested and eating at unusual times. Other causes include food poisoning, suppres- sion of natural urges, intestinal parasites, changesof lifestyle and seasonal changes. Pathogenesis: (Samprapti) When accumulated Vata in the gastrointestinal tract becomes aggravated it causes Kapha (water) to move downward, from the stomach dampeningthe digestive fire. This causes the faeces to becomewatery and produces diarrhoea. If Pachaka Pitta is aggravated it liquefies the food, which is notdigested properly and in its unabsorbed state it is passed out. Prodromal symptoms: (Purvarupa rupa) These may include prickling pain in the chest, rec-tum and alimentary tract, weak body, constipa-tion, gas and indigestion. Signs and symptoms: (Rupa)"

Its taste is sweet andbitter and it is balancing to Pitta and Vata. Traditionally respected as a digestive aid, itscooling properties are effective in relievinginflammatory conditions, soothing irritated tis-sues and curbing diarrhoea and IBS. Modernresearch has borne this out and demonstrated itsability to soothe heartburn and indigestion(Dalvi et al 1990). Shatavari also enhancesimmunity and has been shown to improvemacrophage activity in response to Candida albi- cans (Rege and Dahanukar 1993). The nourishing effect of shatavari is useful for people who aredepleted by chronic bowel problems and whohave lost weight. It is available in powder andcapsule form. When used for treating digestiveproblems take Introduction Shatavari translates “she who possesses a hundred husbands” as this herb is the most important reju-venative tonic for women in Ayurvedic medicine.As a nourishing herb it is also used for a wide vari-ety of ailments in children.

If vata were disturbed, the diet would include oils, butter, and sweet food. If kapha were disturbed, the diet would include bitter, sour, vinegary, spicy, dry food. If pitta were disturbed, the diet would include mild tasting food, grains, lentils, and moderate amounts of sweets and oils. Patients are given a restricted diet of small quantities of mung dal (a type of lentil) or yogurt and rice. Depriving the patient of drinking water helps in ascites, edema, and certain kidney diseases where large amounts of water are retained in the body.TABLE 2.10 Group of Herbs To Mitigate Kapha3 exclude the use of sucrose, provided it is consumed in balance with a normal diet2 that is consistent with Ayurvedic recommendations. Honey and jaggery are believed to pacify kapha and pitta, respectively, and may be useful in respective DMs. Patients are also asked to stop smoking tobacco, eliminate alcohol consumption, and restrict sleeping time to about 8 h/day. Individual herbs are generally not used in Ayurvedic therapies. Because therapies are based on a predominant dosa and body constitution, they always include formulas con- taining many herbs and sometimes various minerals. In Ayurveda, every disease has one or two predominant dosas that need to be balanced according to the constitution of the patient; therefore, one therapy may not be applicable to all patients even though the patients share the same disease.

Those who prac-tise it daily have found that they have less bacter-ial infection on their skin and that it helps joint prob- lems. This may be related to the linoleic acid that makes up 40% of sesame oil and has antibacterialand anti-inflammatory effects. Sesame oil stimulates antibody production and enhances immunity. It alsohas anticancer properties and has been shown toinhibit the growth of malignant melanoma (Sharma and Clark 1998). Daily abhyanga is best done in the morning. Rub rich, almost odourless oil expr essed from sesame seeds is stable and contains an antioxidant system comprising sesamol and sesamo linal formed from sesamolin, which substantially reduce its oxidationrate (Price and Smith 1999). If properly stored,sesame oil is not likely to go rancid, making it pop-ular as cooking oil in India and China. It is alsohighly nutritious, rich in vitamins A, B and E aswell as the minerals iron, calcium, magnesium, cop-per, silicic acid and phosphorus. It contains linoleicacid and alpha linoleic acid as well as lecithin, andthis may go some way to explaining its benefit to thebrain and nervous system. Like olive oil, sesame oilis considered good for lowering harmful choles-terol levels (Patnaik 1993).

46, How is the digestion fire (Agni) treated in Ayurveda?," Ayurveda uses herbs like ginger, cumin, and trikatu to boost digestion fire (Agni) and improve metabolism. This treatment helps clear ama (toxins) from the body."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 196?","hot, dry, light and fragrant. Popular remedies for raising digestive fire include: ●Trikatu (ginger, long pepper and black pepper) ●Trikulu (clove, cinnamon, cardamom) ●Pippali ●Ginger ●Hingwastaka (lavan (salt), hing (asafoetida),trikatu, ajmoda, kalijeera, jeera).To clear toxins: Ama pachana Bitter and pungent herbs generally have the abilityto clear Ama from the gastrointestinal tract. Remed- ies for cleaning toxins include: ●General use for all three doshic types: Triphalawhich is a mixture of amalaki, haritaki, bibhitaki ●For Vata: haritaki; hingwastaka; lavan bhaskar; five salts ●For Pitta : guduchi and ginger; coriander; amalaki ●For Kapha: Triphala guggulu; Trikatu. Stages of digestion According to Ayurveda there are three stages ofdigestion. The first stage is governed by Kapha and helps in digestion of food. Samana Vayu controls peristaltic movements and absorption of food.Apana Vayu controls defecation and expulsion of gases. Thirteen forms of Agni Jatharagni This is the digestive fire which imparts energy toall the secretions and enzymes in the process ofdigestion and resides in the stomach and smallintestine. It is not simply responsible for digestingand absorbing nutrients from food but also fordestroying pathogenic micro-organisms in the gut.If the digestive fire is low and digestion incom-plete as a result, partially digested or undigestedfood ferments and breeds toxins in the gut, therebycompromising the immune system. There are four different conditions of agni: 1.Variable (Vishama) 2.High (Tikshna) 3.Low (Manda) 4.Balanced ( Sama). Vishamagni Digestive fire tends to be variable in Vata types with their fluctuating nature and nervous diges-tion. It is caused by over heavy/light diet andactivities which increase Vata and in turn it causes given to children through their diet to maintain the health of the digestive tract. Agni can also be main- tained by regular exercise, yoga, deep breathing(pranyama), meditation, and proper eating. Ill health develops as a result of either excess, deficient or abnormal agni, which all eventually become low digestive fire. Weak agni lowers immunity as ama is formed from poor digestion and obstructs the channels ( srotas) throughout the body. The undigested food mass: Ama If digestive fire is low it leaves a residue of undi-gested or partly digested food that can accumu-late, stagnate and ferment. This is known as ama,from the root “ am”, to harm or weaken. Its forma- tion and accumulation is said to be the beginningof the disease process for all diseases. It weakensthe defence system and lowers resistance to dis-eases starting from the common cold. Hence agni is the key to health. Agni is increased by pungent, sour and salty Ayurvedic detoxification and “rejuvenation” is the primary approach to maintaining positivehealth. Detoxification of the body and “rejuven-ation” (nourishment of the tissues) are not confinedonly to treatment of disease but also to enhancingresistance. To understand the cause and treatment of this accumulation of toxins and its subsequent dam-age, from an Ayurvedic perspective, it is import-ant to clarify the concepts of agni and ama. Agni or digestive fire transforms and metabolizes nourish-ment from the environment. When agni is strong this nourishment is digested into its fundamentalfive elements and then these are absorbed eventu-ally to become our cells and tissues (see dhatus,  p. 75). When healthy, any of the digested food thatis not useful to the body is eliminated via the threepathways of elimination (malas): urine, faeces andsweat (see malas, p. 76). When agni is not functioning properly, toxins"
47, What is the role of nasya (nasal administration of oils) in treating Vata problems?," Nasya is used to balance Vata dosha, especially in treating psychological issues like anxiety. Oils like sesame or narayan oil are administered nasally."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 10?","ﬂation (nasya) is also an important treatment wherein herbal powders and medicated oils are administered in the nostrils as per the case; vacha powder and oil, anu tail, panchendriya vardhan tail, and fresh juice of nirgundi are commonly used formulations.17 Shirodhara is another part of the treatment (shiro = head and dhara = slow uniform dripping of a liquid substance). This is basically the paciﬁcatory therapy wherein liquid medicaments like medicated oil, ghrita (clariﬁed butter made out of cow’s milk), decoctions of various suitable herbs, and buttermilk are allowed to trickle slowly on the forehead of the patient in a supine posture. Formulations used in the treatment are as follows: 1.Brahmi ghruta containing vacha, brahmi, kushtha, shankhpushpi, and ghruta  2.Kushmanda ghruta made by cooking ghruta with 18 times its quantity of kushmanda juice and paste of yashtimadhu 3.Kalyanaka churna containing 17 herbs treatment. The therapies can be used for prolonged periods of time without any toxic side effects. Oleation is considered the most effective remedy in the treatment of vata diseases. Medicated oils either given orally or applied externally, or both, help in the restoration of muscle strength. Massage increases circulation, prevents nerve degeneration, and promotes tissue building. It renders the body soft and helps in the elimination of accumulated waste materials that obstruct the channels causing vitiation of vata. Oleation followed by fomen- tation liqueﬁes dosas adhered in the channels and brings them to the gastrointestinal tract (kostha) where they are expelled by the downﬂow action of purgation. Hemoglobin levels increased in one study in both albino rats and humans after oleation.29 Heat applied by steam, poultice, hot sandbags, or other means reduces the stiffness and muscle spasms by decreasing efferent activity, improving tissue ﬂexibility, and hastening tissue healing by mind, and channels (srotas) occluded by the dosa by using samshodhana chikitsa. Vataja should be treated with enema therapy (basti), pittaja with purgation therapy (virechana), and kaphaja with emesis therapy (vamana). This is followed by medicinal recipes. Sam- shamana therapy does not work well if puriﬁcation is not made a priority.6 A study by Nagashayana et al.16 establishes the necessity of panchakarma therapy in Ayurveda med- ication before palliative therapy. Primary therapy described in epilepsy is oleation (snehana) where narayan tail is com- monly used followed by fomentation (swedana). These are also the preparatory measures physician may use emesis therapy in epilepsy where drugs are suitably prepared; a common vehicle is honey and rock salt followed by a postemesis regimen. Nasal insuf- ﬂation (nasya) is also an important treatment wherein herbal powders and medicated oils are administered in the nostrils as per the case; vacha powder and oil, anu tail, panchendriya Oil therapy (snehana) using oils internally and externally, is also important in Ayurveda, particu-larly as a prelude to detoxification ( pancha karma) (see p. 167). Warm oil is applied in large amountsover the patient’s body. According to Ayurveda,applying sesame oil to the skin in this way has asignificant detoxifying effect. By stimulating thetissues in the body it helps to prevent toxins fromaccumulating in the system and to drain into thegut for elimination. For external use, sesame oil is prepared by heat- ing the oil with one or two drops of water until thewater evaporates. Heating the oil has been shown toincrease the antioxidant effect. When taken inter-nally, cold-pressed sesame oil is used to moistendry Vata membranes and tissues, and to soften and loosen dry and hardened toxins. It is best takenraw 1–2 tbsp daily. Caution: abhyanga should be avoided immedi- ately after administering enemas, emetics or purga-tives, during pregnancy, the first stages of fever or"

It has a deﬁned diag- nostic system covering all physiological functions and organs, as well as speciﬁc treatments and management techniques for each disease. Although Ayurveda is thousands of years old, many of its core principles are consistent with modern medicine. Ayurvedic medicine offers a wealth of relatively effective, safe, and economic health-care therapies.

It is likely that these herbs may have selective inhibitory activity on COX- 2 because they have not been known to cause any toxicity in the stomach or intestine. Ergolide, a sequiterpine lactone from Inula britanica, has been shown to inhibit the COX- 2 activity.49 Semicarpous anacardium has been shown to bring back the levels of altered AO defense system in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats.41 These and other biochemical mechanisms of action of these herbs should be further investigated.References 1.

Rub Sesame oil is immensely popular in India where its use in oil massage (abhyanga) is part of everyday life and an important aspect of Ayurveda. It is thefavourite oil for massage as its chemical structuregives it a unique ability to penetrate the skin easily,nourishing and detoxifying even the deepest tissuelayers. In fact it is said to benefit all the seven tis-sues (dhatus). It is the best oil for balancing Vata but can also be used sparingly for Pitta and Kapha. People with high Vata can be prone to anxiety, rich, almost odourless oil expr essed from sesame seeds is stable and contains an antioxidant system comprising sesamol and sesamo linal formed from sesamolin, which substantially reduce its oxidationrate (Price and Smith 1999). If properly stored,sesame oil is not likely to go rancid, making it pop-ular as cooking oil in India and China. It is alsohighly nutritious, rich in vitamins A, B and E aswell as the minerals iron, calcium, magnesium, cop-per, silicic acid and phosphorus. It contains linoleicacid and alpha linoleic acid as well as lecithin, andthis may go some way to explaining its benefit to thebrain and nervous system. Like olive oil, sesame oilis considered good for lowering harmful choles-terol levels (Patnaik 1993). White seeds produce themost oil, but in India it is said that the best oil forhealing is extracted from black sesame seeds.

Ayurvedic science of psychiatric disorders (Ayurvediya manas roga vijnana) or ratio- nal Ayurvedic psychiatry — This deals with clinical conditions where the disease and its treatment are based on fundamental principles of Ayurveda (i.e., theories of ﬁve elements [pancamahabhuta], tridosa, triguna, etc.). The diseases such as psy- chosis (unmada) and others are well characterized. 2. Demonology (science and knowledge of evil spirits) (bhutavidya) — This deals with psychiatric problems like psychosis (bhutonmada, grahavesa) in a nonconven- tional manner. Psychiatry emerged to the present scientiﬁc shape from demonol- ogy, where the disease and its treatment is not based on classical principles of Ayurveda and science (vijnana). Rather, it is based on paranormal factors like the doctrine of deeds (karma), planets (graham), evil spirits (bhuta), and others. The Psychiatric Disorders 443 25.5.1 Psychosis Psychosis is described in Ayurveda as a major psychiatric disease. There are several types identiﬁed in terms of the set of signs, symptoms, and the pattern of behavior alterations referable to the three dosas and their combinations. A separate category of psychosis, described as agantuja unmada by Charaka and as bhutonmada by Susruta, forms an interesting dimension of Ayurvedic psychiatry. In this context about a dozen psychiatric syndromes are described and named after different planets or divinities (grahas). Thus, bhutonmada is a specialized aspect of Ayurvedic psy- chiatry using symbolic terms and need not be pushed into the realm of demonology. In the conventional medicine, schizophrenia is a major psychotic (presence of halluci- nations or delusions) illness. The major feature of schizophrenia is a decline in psychosocial functioning, with a tendency to move down in a person’s social circle.

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity. Optimum functioning of the digestive tract Ayurvedic approach Herbs are given to balance Vata, to strengthen thenervous system and the urinary tract. ●Shilajit is a popular remedy. For children youngerthan 5 years, quarter of a gram is given twicedaily, mixed with milk on an empty stomach.For children up to age 15, half a gram is giventwice daily. A much-used Ayurvedic formulacontaining shilajit is Chandraprabha. Childrenof about 5 years are given half a tablet in themorning and another half in the evening on anempty stomach with half a cup of milk.Children over 10 years of age can take one fulltablet, twice daily with milk. ●Sesame seeds (1tsp) are given to children to chew at night presumably for their calcium con- tent but also because sesame is a major remedyused to balance Vata.  ●A warm sesame oil massage at night followedby a warm bath can be effective in promotinggood sleep and uninterrupted by enuresis.

Introduction Brahmi derives its name from Brahman meaning pure consciousness, probably because of its abilityto calm mental turbulence and aid meditationenabling knowledge of Brahman. [It is often con-fused with its close relative gotu kola (Centella asiat- ica) which is also called Brahmi in Northern India.] Internal uses Digestive system Bacopa has a suppressant action on appetite and so is best combined with warming digestive herbssuch as ginger or cardamom (Pole 2005).

Introduction Brahmi derives its name from Brahman meaning cerned, metals have been used mainly as bhasma (ash). Bhasmaliterally means anything inorganic or organic burnt into its ash. The process of burning in Ayurvedic terminology is known as marana (calcination). The process of calci- nation is also employed for preparation of bhasmas of coral, pearl, and shell. The well- known Ayurvedic texts, Charaka Samhita and Susruta Samhita, which are regarded as the texts scripted by the forefathers of Ayurveda, include ample description of the use of the metals and minerals in the treatment of diseases. It is also reﬂected in later texts that were attempted to simplify the knowledge of charaka and susruta (e.g., Astanga Hridaya, Vagbhata, Mdhahva Nidan, Sharangadhara Samhita, and Bhava Prakash).2,3 In this chapter, an attempt has been made to describe various medicinal uses of bhasmas in general and swrana bhasma in particular.

65, How does liquorice support immunity in Ayurveda?, Liquorice enhances immunity by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies. It also has antiviral properties and supports the adrenal glands.," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 163?","1979, Shinada et al 1986). This in turn increases antiviral activity, as interferon binds to cell sur-faces and stimulates the synthesis of proteins thatimpair the ability of viruses, including herpes, tosurvive. It contains phyto-oestrogens, sugars andflavonoids. The most investigated component isglycyrrhizic acid, which seems to be responsiblefor many of liquorice’s anti-inflammatory proper-ties. In the stomach glycyrrhizic acid is convertedinto glycyrrhetic acid, which inhibits the enzymethat metabolizes the natural steroid cortisol, result-ing in higher circulating levels of this steroid with itsanti-inflammatory effects. Components of liquoriceact as powerful antioxidants. Liquorice is particu-larly useful for treating respiratory tract infections such as pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia.Numerous studies have demonstrated it to be ben-eficial to the liver and to support the adrenal glands,providing protection from the effects of stress. Immune system A number of trials have demonstrated an antiviraleffect including anticytomegalovirus (Numazakeet al 1994) and antiherpes simplex (Pompei et al1980) properties. Its anti-inflammatory effects canbe applied for the relief of a wide variety of condi-tions including arthritis, skin problems such aseczema and psoriasis, headaches, hayfever andasthma. Liquorice is classed as a desmutagen,  due to its ability to bind to toxic chemicals and carcinogens. The polyphenol flavonoids known asisoflavones may reduce the negative effect of LDL cholesterol and reduce atherosclerotic lesions(Tillotson et al 2001). Reproductive system The steroid-like compounds in liquorice can change to oestradiol and oestrone, which areoestrogen precursors, giving liquorice mild oestro- genic properties. Internal uses Digestive system Liquorice has a well-documented reputation for healing ulcers (Baker 1994). It lowers stomach acidlevels and relieves heartburn and indigestion. Italso acts as a mild laxative. Through its beneficialaction on the liver, it increases bile flow and lowerscholesterol levels. Its antihepatoxic effects makeliquorice useful in treating chronic hepatitis and possibly cirrhosis (Tillotson et al 2001). Nervous system Liquorice is an adaptogen that improves resilience to stress. Respiratory system In the respiratory system its demulcent actionreduces irritation and inflammation. It is one ofthe best remedies for soothing sore throats and drycoughs and it also has an expectorant effect (Barnett1997), making it useful in treatment of irritatingcoughs, asthma and chest infections. Its antialler-genic effect is useful for hayfever, allergic rhinitis,conjunctivitis and bronchial asthma. Immune system The antibiotic activity of golden seal’s alkaloids against a wide range of infecting organisms,including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Diplococcal pneumonia, are well documented(Hwang et al 2003, Scazzocchio et al 2001). Goldenseal also has remarkable immunostimulatoryactivity, increasing blood supply to the spleen andthereby promoting optimal activity of the spleenand the release of immune-potentiating com-pounds. One of the alkaloids, berberine, is apotent activator of macrophages (Kang et al 2002).It should be noted that only sustainable sources ofgolden seal should be used. Liquorice is another great immune enhancer. Honoured for thousands of years as a treatmentfor inflammatory conditions, modern studies havedocumented that liquorice has steroid-like actions(Shibata 2000). It enhances immunity by stimulat-ing formation and efficiency of white blood cellsand antibodies. It is effective against candida andseveral types of bacteria including the Staph. spp."

Introduction Another plant named after Brahma, the all-pervading consciousness, because of its centralaction on the brain. Gotu kola is considered a Sattvic herb that enhances wisdom and intelligence and isespecially useful for children. In Nepal a leaf of gotu kola is given to children in a spring ceremony toaid memory and concentration and help them intheir school work (Tillotson et al 2001). Internal uses Digestive system Gotu kola is used in the early stages of dysentery in children (Bakhru 1998) with cumin. It can also beused for indigestion, acidity and ulcers as it coolsheat and reduces inflammation. Its antibacterialaction could contribute to its antiulcer properties. Nervous system One of the best tonics for the brain, gotu kola ●Shilajit and liquorice help to strengthen theadrenals and are good supportive remedies forthe nervous system. ●If a child is angry and aggressive use Pitta calming herbs such as sandalwood, gotu kola, chamomile,coriander, shatavari and bringaraj.  ●Bacopa, gotu kola, shilajit and guduchi canimprove memory and concentration (Tillotson et al 2001, p. 343).

67, How does Ayurveda treat hay fever in children?," Ayurveda treats hay fever with herbs like holy basil, ginger, and calamus for Vata, and coriander juice, chamomile, and gotu kola for Pitta. Trikatu and ginger tea are used for Kapha types."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 242?","Herbs can be given to enhance immunity and general health for a few months before the hayfeverseason begins, to enable the child to cope with thehigh levels of pollen when they come (the ImmuneSystem, p. 150). Useful herbs include golden rod(Solidago virgaurea), plantain, ground ivy (Nepetahederacea), echinacea, garlic, ginseng and liquorice,which can be continued throughout the hayfeverseason. Golden rod has anti-inflammatory andastringent properties. Ground ivy has been usedfor centuries for its anti-inflammatory, antisepticand astringent actions which have been borne outby recent research (Mascolo 1987). Ayurvedic approach According to Ayurveda, hayfever is caused by toxins/ama in the body and the main approach  to treatment is removal of impurities from theblood. According to Vasant Lad hayfever is aKapha problem as it affects the respiratory tract and the lungs, which are ruled by Kapha. Howeveronce the heat rises in spring and Pitta is increasing, tion with herbal teas. ●Taking honey or honeycomb can be continuedthroughout the hayfever season.  Because allergic reactions, including hayfever, arerelated to a complex range of background causesand not only the offending allergens, it is alwaysnecessary to assess each individual child’s consti- tution and lifestyle.Ayurvedic treatment of hayfever A novel, botanical formulation (Aller-7) has beendeveloped for treatment of allergic rhinitis using a combination of extracts from seven medicinalplants including amalaki, ginger and long pepper,which have a proven history of efficacy and healthbenefits. Vasant Lad (lecture notes 1991) recommends chewing grains of bee pollen before the spring toprevent hayfever, as well as taking tea made fromequal parts of liquorice, long pepper, and lemongrass three times a day. For wheezing he recom-mends boiling a 1–2tsp of liquorice root in a cup of water for 5 minutes and before giving it to thechild to add 5 drops of mahanaryan oil or 1–4tsp of the general health and vitality of the child should improve, reducing susceptibility. Herbs can be prescribed to nourish the body, particularly the immune system, and to balance thedigestive tract and combined with gentle methodsto minimize symptoms associated with inflamma-tion and swelling. ●A combination of echinacea and liquorice is oftenused for the prevention and relief of hayfever.Both inhibit IgE-mediated allergic responsesthat give rise to the irritation and inflammationof the airways, while they provide symptomaticrelief through their anti-inflammatory anddecongestant properties respectively. ●Recommendations for boosting the immunesystem (see p. 160) can be followed using immuneand digestive tonics such as liquorice, turmeric,pippali and ginger. 1–2tsp of liquorice root in a cup of water for 5 minutes and before giving it to thechild to add 5 drops of mahanaryan oil or 1–4tsp of ghee. This can be sipped every 15–30 minutes.Should it cause vomiting this is beneficial as iteliminates Kapha from the stomach and clears  congestion and wheezing rapidly. David Frawley recommends strengthening the immune system and the lungs prior to the hayfeverseason using dietary recommendations for one’sdosha and taking tonic herbs such as ashwagandha and bala as well as Chayawan prash (Frawley2000, p. 269). All types of hayfever require treatment using herbs to reduce congestion and reduce the sensitiv-ity of the mucous membranes. Holy basil is a popu-lar remedy and can be taken as an infusion withhoney. ●For Vata: calamus (Acorus calamus), ginger  and liquorice tea. Ginger paste applied to thehead (see headaches/pain).

It helps soothe irritation, reduce inflammation, and strengthen respiratory health."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 162?","Internal uses Digestive system Liquorice has a well-documented reputation for healing ulcers (Baker 1994). It lowers stomach acidlevels and relieves heartburn and indigestion. Italso acts as a mild laxative. Through its beneficialaction on the liver, it increases bile flow and lowerscholesterol levels. Its antihepatoxic effects makeliquorice useful in treating chronic hepatitis and possibly cirrhosis (Tillotson et al 2001). Nervous system Liquorice is an adaptogen that improves resilience to stress. Respiratory system In the respiratory system its demulcent actionreduces irritation and inflammation. It is one ofthe best remedies for soothing sore throats and drycoughs and it also has an expectorant effect (Barnett1997), making it useful in treatment of irritatingcoughs, asthma and chest infections. Its antialler-genic effect is useful for hayfever, allergic rhinitis,conjunctivitis and bronchial asthma. Immune system 1979, Shinada et al 1986). This in turn increases antiviral activity, as interferon binds to cell sur-faces and stimulates the synthesis of proteins thatimpair the ability of viruses, including herpes, tosurvive. It contains phyto-oestrogens, sugars andflavonoids. The most investigated component isglycyrrhizic acid, which seems to be responsiblefor many of liquorice’s anti-inflammatory proper-ties. In the stomach glycyrrhizic acid is convertedinto glycyrrhetic acid, which inhibits the enzymethat metabolizes the natural steroid cortisol, result-ing in higher circulating levels of this steroid with itsanti-inflammatory effects. Components of liquoriceact as powerful antioxidants. Liquorice is particu-larly useful for treating respiratory tract infections such as pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia.Numerous studies have demonstrated it to be ben-eficial to the liver and to support the adrenal glands,providing protection from the effects of stress. with their antimicrobial, antispasmodic andexpectorant pr operties, will help resolve infec- tion as well as relax the airways. ●Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) leaf extracts have beenshown to benefit children’s asthma (Keville1996). A small trial with Ginkgo shows promis-ing results in improving the clinical symptomsof asthma. The herb appears to work by a num-ber of mechanisms, notably as a platelet-activat-ing factor antagonist (Mahmoud et al 2000).Liquorice is a very interesting herb in this con-text. It has soothing and expectorant properties,and helps to support the adrenal glands, pro-viding a natural counterpart to cortisone andhelping to reduce the effects of stress and aller-gic reactions. This is particularly useful for chil-dren using cortisone inhalers or oral steroidswhen seeking to find a herbal alternative.

Liquorice is classed as a desmutagen,  due to its ability to bind to toxic chemicals and carcinogens. The polyphenol flavonoids known asisoflavones may reduce the negative effect of LDL cholesterol and reduce atherosclerotic lesions(Tillotson et al 2001).

72, What Ayurvedic herbs are recommended for treating Kapha-related respiratory issues?," For Kapha-related respiratory problems, Ayurvedic herbs such as ginger, turmeric, and Trikatu (a combination of black pepper, long pepper, and ginger) are used to reduce excess mucus and improve lung function."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 164?","AYURVEDIC APPROACH The lungs are the primary site of Kapha. Accordingto Ayurveda phlegm is produced in the stomachand then accumulates in the lungs (Frawley 2000,p. 195). Most respiratory disorders are thereforeKapha problems. Kapha predominates in childhood which accounts for why these problems abound inchildren. Kapha predominant children will be  particularly prone. By reducing Kapha foods (see p. 68) particularly in Kapha seasons (winter and early spring) and using Kapha reducing herbs (those that are warming, light and dry, see p. 14), manyrespiratory problems can be prevented. The lungs are also pervaded by air (Vata) when prana enters the body. Vata disturbance can lead to spasm of the airways as well as lowered immun-ity, predisposing to colds and coughs. Immunitywill generally be lowered by insomnia, stress, anxiety and grief and low digestive fire (see ImmuneSystem, p. 150). Pitta disorders of the lungs can also occur Kapha type cough In India, in the treatment of Kapha type cough, Ayurvedic doctors first administer an emetic if thechild is strong, with barley and pungent herbs suchas pippali.

It is used to stimulate digestive fire (Agni), improve metabolism, and treat digestive disorders."," Lakshmi C. Mishra - Scientific Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies, p. 162?","16 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies The founding fathers of Ayurveda believed that the world is made up of ﬁve elements called Panch-mahabhuta. Their criterion was that an element must not be “divisible into” a new material. They determined that earth, water, ﬁre, air, and space are indivisible and therefore designated them as the ﬁve basic elements (Panchmahabhuta). The human body in Ayurveda was also believed to be made up of these ﬁve elements. In order to understand the whole body physiology, Ayurveda postulates three main factors called tridosa, which are also called biomaterials, biofactors, or bioenergies. These tridosas or biomaterials are vata, pitta, and kapha. The primary dominant elements in vata, pitta, and kapha are air, ﬁre, and earth, respectively.

Traditionally respected as a digestive aid, itscooling properties are effective in relievinginflammatory conditions, soothing irritated tis-sues and curbing diarrhoea and IBS. Modernresearch has borne this out and demonstrated itsability to soothe heartburn and indigestion(Dalvi et al 1990). Shatavari also enhancesimmunity and has been shown to improvemacrophage activity in response to Candida albi- cans (Rege and Dahanukar 1993).

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity. Optimum functioning of the digestive tract Introduction Shatavari translates “she who possesses a hundred husbands” as this herb is the most important reju-venative tonic for women in Ayurvedic medicine.As a nourishing herb it is also used for a wide vari-ety of ailments in children. According to DavidSimon and Deepak Chopra, shatavari is nourish- ing, soothing, cooling, lubricating, useful in condi-tions when the body and mind are overheated,depleted or out of balance (Chopra and Simon2000).Internal uses Digestive system The cooling and demulcent properties of shatavari are used for soothing dry inflamed mucous mem-branes throughout the body, for treating problemsassociated with a disturbance of either Vata or Pitta giving rise to, for example, heartburn, gastri- tis, peptic ulcers, colitis, Crohn’s disease and irrit-able bowel syndrome. It relieves hyperacidity aswell as diarrhoea and dysentery. In a small trial oneight healthy volunteers, shatavari was found to have an equivalent effect to metoclopramide inreducing gastric emptying time (Dalvi et al 1990). Respiratory system Shatavari soothes sore throats and dry coughs, and is used generally for treating irritated conditionsof the respiratory system. Immune system Its immune-stimulating properties combined withits ability to enhance growth and development are particularly applicable to children (Pole 2005).According to Chopra and Simon, shatavari has  a measurable effect on macrophage functionenhancing their ability to fight fungal infections. It enhances the production of natural immune-regulating messenger molecules and protectsblood-producing cells in the bone marrow, thushelping the immune system recover more quicklyafter exposure to toxic chemicals (Chopra andSimon 2000). Shatavari also has adaptogenic prop- erties. Shatavari has antibacterial activity in vitro against a range of bacteria including E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas (Mandal  et al 2000)."

Ayurveda is an ancient philosophy based on a deep understanding of eternal truths about thehuman body, mind and spirit. The traditional nat-ural healing system of India, Ayurveda, is rap-idly growing in popularity in the West today. Athoroughly comprehensive system of healing, itembraces medical science, philosophy, psycho-logy, spiritual understanding as well as astrologyand astronomy. It is based on the accumulatedknowledge and understanding of millennia andyet it is very up to date, offering practical and effect-ive treatment for many modern disorders suchasthma, IBS, anxiety and skin disease. Clinical trialsare being carried out at major Ayurvedic institutionsall over the world as the search continues for treat-ments that are safe and effective through reviewsof Eastern as well as Western medicine.

81, What herbs are recommended for treating respiratory infections in children?," Echinacea, garlic, thyme, and liquorice are commonly used to treat respiratory infections in children. These herbs have antimicrobial properties and support the immune system."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 160?","Children are more prone to upper respiratory infections by one of 200 odd rhinoviruses or othermicro-organisms that can infect the lungs, thananything else. If they are treated speedily withsimple dietary measures and herbal remediescombined with rest and nurture, there is less riskof complications requiring antibiotic treatment(which can be reserved for more serious condi-tions for which there is no better alternative). This is particularly important if the child has a his-tory of catarrh or chest problems or asthma. It hasto be borne in mind that many other infectious diseases begin with cold symptoms before othercharacteristic symptoms emerge, the rash withmeasles, the whoop with whooping cough forexample, and early treatment may lead to a speed-ier resolution. TREATING THE COMMON COLD When using herbs to treat the common cold, theaim is to support the body’s fight against the infec-tion and speed recovery, while at the same timerelieving the often annoying symptoms. Herbs such as echinacea, garlic, thyme, liquorice, ginger and turmeric all have effective immuno-stimulatory as well as antimicrobial actions andwould all be applicable here. Research concerningchildren with recurrent respiratory tract infectionsindicates a tendency to show reduced immunefunction with particular depression in numbers of T lymphocytes. Treatment aimed at stimulatingantibody and T-cell function in 117 children withrecurrent respiratory infections produced beneficialresults (Prusek et al 1987). Pulmonary macrophagesplay a key role in defence against respiratory infec-tion (Gordon and Read 2002), and stimulation ofmacrophage response appears to be a mode ofaction of echinacea (Bauer 2002) and garlic. Both garlic and echinacea have been shown to be effec-tive in respiratory tract infections, and have been recommended in the treatment of children (Bauer 2002, Andrianova et al 2003). Propolis is another excellent anti-infective agent among children is the old-fashioned traditionalEnglish combination of yarrow, elderflowers andpeppermint. The tea is light and refreshing and doesnot taste unpleasant, which is quite a consider-ation when it comes to treating children. They obvi-ously have to be willing to take enough of the herbsfor them to be adequately effective. Yarrow reducesfevers and clears toxins, heat and congestion byaiding elimination via the skin and the kidneysthrough its diaphoretic and diuretic actions. Thevolatile oils and resins have an antimicrobial andanti-inflammatory effect. Elderflowers are an idealherb to take at the onset of any respiratory infection.They stimulate the circulation, enhance sweatingand aid elimination of toxins via the skin and kid-neys. They are well worth using to bring out therash in eruptive infections and thereby speed theresolution of the infection. They have a deconges-tant action, excellent in colds, catarrh, sinusitis andbronchial congestion. Their relaxant effect Herbal treatment needs to include remedies to enhance the digestion and the immune system, such as echinacea, garlic, rosemary, thyme and turmericas well as general tonics for convalescence, includ-ing ashwagandha, cat’s claw (Uncaria tomentosa),marshmallow (Althea off.), astragalus (Astragalusmembranaceus), burdock, liquorice, marigold andnettles. Resistant mucus can be expelled with thehelp of expectorant herbs such as aniseed, colts-foot, elecampane, horehound, hyssop, liquorice,mullein and thyme. This may aggravate a chronicintermittent cough temporarily, but it becomesmore productive and indicates that the child ismore able to throw off the illness. Coltsfoot tea isconsidered the remedy of choice for chroniccough, as it contains bitter tonics as well as sooth-ing and expectorant properties. Hot lemon and honey drinks can be given regu-"

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity.

Besides their aetiopathogenesis, the texts describe brieﬂy but vividly the signs, symptoms, and behavioral alterations in different psychiatric diseases and their classiﬁcations. The psychiatric conditions described in original texts may be classiﬁed as follows: 1. Primary psychological conditions caused purely by manasa dosas (i.e., rajas and tamas). An example is the set of manas dosas vikaras7: lust (kama), anger (krodha), greed (lobha), delusion (moha), jealousy (irsya), pride (mana), eurphoria (mada), sorrow (dukha), grief (soka), anxiety (cinta), neurosis (udvega), fear (bhaya), and happiness (harsa). tissues (dusya) and seat of the vitiated dosa (adhisthana). The Ayurvedic physician pays special attention to the patient’s environment, hereditary and genetic background, and original personality makeup in terms of tridosa and three personality properties (triguna).25.7 Treatment The Ayurvedic management of a psychiatric patient is carried out through three broad streams of therapy: (1) divine therapy (Daivavyapasraya cikitsa), (2) biological therapy (Yuktivyapasraya cikitsa), and (3) psychotherapy (Sattvavajaya). The divine therapy includes the use of religious activities (mantra, japa) and wearing of precious stones. Ayurvedic psychotherapy is practiced incorporating the principles of assurance therapy (asviisana), replacement of negative emotions with positive emotions, and psychological shock ther- apy. In addition, it includes encouraging the patient to ﬁnd or develop a speciﬁc goal, purpose, or meaning in life; ﬁnd a job that gives better job satisfaction; improve relation- Mental health and ailments of psyche have been important considerations in the ﬁeld of medicine from the very beginning.

Agni can also be main- tained by regular exercise, yoga, deep breathing(pranyama), meditation, and proper eating. Ill health develops as a result of either excess, deficient or abnormal agni, which all eventually become low digestive fire. Weak agni lowers immunity as ama is formed from poor digestion and obstructs the channels ( srotas) throughout the body.

This is known as ama,from the root “ am”, to harm or weaken. Its forma- tion and accumulation is said to be the beginningof the disease process for all diseases. It weakensthe defence system and lowers resistance to dis-eases starting from the common cold. Hence agni is the key to health. Agni is increased by pungent, sour and salty According to Ayurveda there are different types of grahani : Vata type, Pitta type, Kapha type and a type where all three doshas are involved: ●When Vata is disturbed ( Vataja), symptoms will tend to be variable.

In experimental studies, gingerol, an active constituent of ginger, had enhanced bile secretion.36 Ginger in combination with long pepper and black pepper (the combina- tion is called trikatu in Ayurvedic literature) promoted the secretion of digestive juices and an increased appetite; it is  also reported useful in patients with gastric disorders accom- panied with clinical symptoms of achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria.42 17.12.2 Foeniculum vulgare (Fennel) Fennel is a promoter of normal GI motility and is an antispasmodic.43 In experimental studies, fennel was reported to stimulate bile ﬂow from the liver, which could help in relieving GI discomfort.44 17.12.3 Curcuma longa (Turmeric) Digestive system Ginger is a warming aid to digestion. It invigorates and settles the stomach and intestines, stimulatingthe appetite and enhancing digestion by encour-aging secretion of digestive enzymes. It movesstagnant food and subsequent accumulation oftoxins, which has a far-reaching effect throughoutthe body, increasing general health and vitalityand enhancing immunity. It soothes indigestionand calms wind. Its pain-relieving and relaxingeffects in the digestive system relieve colic andspasm, abdominal pain, distension and flatulentindigestion, and help relieve griping from diar-rhoea and dysentery. It is said to be a good cure fora hangover. It also relieves postoperative nausea(Visalyaputra et al 1998).

Respiratory system Ginger has a stimulating and expectorant action in These results were conﬁrmed in several subsequent studies using several of ginger’s constituents, including beta-sesquiphellandrene, beta-bisabolene, gingesulfonic acid, cur- cumene, and 6-shogaol. The results showed a demonstration of antiulcer effects and protection of gastric mucosa against alcohol, NSAIDs, and hydrochloric acid.34,35 Rats given ginger extracts (gingerols) had enhanced bile secretion.36 17.12.1.2.2 Clinical Studies A Chinese case series reported that an herbal mixture containing ginger was effective in halting upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.37 There are no randomized, controlled trials in humans evaluating ginger’s effect as a carminative or ulcer remedy. 17.12.1.2.3 Dose There is disagreement on the optimal form and dose of ginger. A pediatric dose is not established. Reputable physicians and herbalists recommend a range of doses. A dose of dried ginger at 250 mg, four times daily taken orally,38 is commonly used. Some German"

In endotoxic indigestion, digestive drugs have to be used. If there is excess kapha, then vamana (emesis) is done under a physician’s supervision followed by diges- tive drugs such as panchakola curna, agnitudi vati, and rasonadi vati (Table 17.1). 2. Acid indigestion is treated with light and easily digestible food. If there is excess pitta, virecana (purgation) is followed by using antacids, such as sankha vati (Table 17.1). 3. To control vata in static indigestion, virecana with castor oil or Terminalia chebula is used followed by basti (enema) treatment done under medical supervision. To relieve constipation and indigestion, compound herbal powders such as bhaskara- lavana curna and hingvastaka curna are used (Table 17.1). 4. In any stage of indigestion, ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), asafetida (Ferula foetida), and rock salt are used as digestives and carminatives.6 316 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 6. 1 g each of the powdered fruit of long pepper and salt to be taken with lemon juice twice daily with meals. 7.

An alternative term is dyspepsia. Dyspepsia is often used to refer to upper abdominal pain or discomfort but may also encompass symptoms of early satiety, postprandial abdominal bloating or distension, nausea, and vomiting. Dyspepsia can be episodic or persistent and is often exacerbated by eating. Indigestion is a general term used to describe discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen or chest, usually after meals.  Ayurvedic treatment is focused on the correction of gastrointestinal pathology for most of the endogenous disorders ranging from indigestion to arthritis. Ayurvedic texts describe the anatomy and physiology of the digestive system at great lengths. Here is a brief insight into the concepts of digestion and indigestion.17.2 Ayurvedic Concept 17.2.1 The Stomach and Digestion 366 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 2. Fennel seed (Foeniculum vulgare) — Fennel is another herb that is used to relieve spasm of the gastrointestinal tract, feelings of fullness, and ﬂatulence.21 3. Psyllium (Plantago ovata) — An herbal product derived from seeds of the plantago plant, psyllium is a source of dietary ﬁber that may aid constipation and diarrhea by absorbing water and adding bulk to the stool. (Be sure to drink one to two glasses of water when you take psyllium, and drink plenty of extra water through- out the day.) If psyllium aggravates symptoms instead of relieving them, discon- tinue using it. 4. Acidophilus —  This form of beneﬁcial bacteria normally inhabits the digestive tract, helps digest food, and also fortiﬁes the body against digestive disorders by stopping the harmful bacteria that cause disease from growing uncurbed. It is especially important to take after a round of antibiotics. (Obtain pills"

As such, there is a big scope of utilizing Ayurvedic approach and therapeutics as an adjunct to the disease-oriented therapy of modem psychiatry to afford a full treatment. 25.7.1 Ayurvedic Herbs and Herbal Formulas Besides the nondrug approach to prevention and treatment of mental disorders, the Ayurvedic texts describe a large number of herbal and herbomineral formulas for treating mental diseases. Many of these formulas are still in popular use in the hands of a large number of Ayurvedic practitioners. The scientiﬁc validity of many of these herbs and herbal formulas drugs has been tested on scientiﬁc parameters, and several of these have been found effective. Mental health and ailments of psyche have been important considerations in the ﬁeld of medicine from the very beginning.

Because Ayurvedic dietary herbal supplements are relatively safe, their use in managing various psychiatric disorders is explored here.25.2 Basic Ayurvedic Concept of Psychiatry The contemporary Ayurvedic psychiatry in terms of concepts consists of two components, namely: 1.

Ayurvedic science of psychiatric disorders (Ayurvediya manas roga vijnana) or ratio- nal Ayurvedic psychiatry — This deals with clinical conditions where the disease and its treatment are based on fundamental principles of Ayurveda (i.e., theories of ﬁve elements [pancamahabhuta], tridosa, triguna, etc.). The diseases such as psy- chosis (unmada) and others are well characterized. 2. Demonology (science and knowledge of evil spirits) (bhutavidya) — This deals with psychiatric problems like psychosis (bhutonmada, grahavesa) in a nonconven- tional manner. Psychiatry emerged to the present scientiﬁc shape from demonol- ogy, where the disease and its treatment is not based on classical principles of Ayurveda and science (vijnana). Rather, it is based on paranormal factors like the doctrine of deeds (karma), planets (graham), evil spirits (bhuta), and others. The"

These include hyperkalaemia,pseudo-aldosteronism and hypertension. Liquorice is contraindicated if there is a history of hyperten-sion, and may result in excessive potassium loss ifcombined with diuretics or laxatives. Liquoricemay potentiate the effects of prednisolone andshould not be used during pregnancy (Mills andBone 2000).

It is likely that exposure to allergens and development of atopy later in life are responsible for late onset of asthma. The role of viral infections in causation in adults is not clear; they may be a trigger for acute exacerbation. The overall description of the prognosis of asthma in Ayurveda and the current practice appear to be similar.13.8 Management 13.8.1 Ayurvedic Approach Management of asthma in Ayurveda judiciously encompasses herbal and herbomineral drugs in addition to advising a healthy lifestyle and diet that are contrary to the cause of disease and the disease itself. As the pathogenesis of this disorder involves an imbalance between the vata and kapha, the therapy is directed at correcting this imbalance. In addition, there are a few therapies for controlling the acute symptoms. The texts recommend that the patients should be given sudation and steaming therapy 210 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies13.1 Introduction Bronchial asthma is a common global health problem. Individuals of all ages are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and occasionally fatal. The prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide, especially in children.1 Over the past few decades, there have been signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances leading to improved understanding of the disease and better management. However, the current modes of therapy in conventional medicine do not cure the disorder but control the symptomatology. There is a need to explore safe alternative therapies, such as Ayurvedic medicine, so that they can be successfully integrated with conventional therapy to provide maximal beneﬁts to patients.13.2 Deﬁnition Ayurveda: Svasa (increased or difﬁcult breathing, dyspnea) refers to the disorders of the respiratory system. There are ﬁve kinds: ksudraka, tamaka, chchinna, mahan, and urdhava. Of these, tamaka svasa refers to asthma.2–5 214 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 13.7 Clinical Course and Prognosis According to Ayurveda, of all the signiﬁcant svasa disorders, tamaka svasa (asthma) is yapya (i.e., controllable).1 It is not curable and symptoms are likely to persist. The only exceptions to this may be disease of short duration in strong, healthy, young individuals and if the disease severity is mild. In the past few decades, a lot of research has been conducted to determine the natural history of asthma. Asthma symptoms may disappear in one third to one half of children at puberty.38,39 Even though symptoms may be absent, abnormalities in lung function can be demonstrated. However, symptoms may appear later in adulthood. Nearly two thirds of children continue suffering from the disorder through adolescence and adulthood. Asthma may have onset in adult life.40 The exact proportion of such patients is not known. It is likely that exposure to allergens and development of atopy later in life are 224 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies medications and modern medicine may be able to improve the control of this common respiratory disorder.13.10  Areas of Research  Further research is needed to: 1. Establish efﬁcacy of various Ayurvedic preparations used in asthma by good quality randomized controlled trials. 2. Determine the active principles in various Ayurvedic medications. 3. Evaluate the impact of Ayurvedic medications on the natural history. 4. Evaluate the role of immunomodulator medications available in Ayurveda.13.11  Conclusions The review of literature highlights need for more research in utility of Ayurvedic prepa- rations in bronchial asthma. At present, the medications and the management are not well standardized. As a large number of experimental studies have documented the presence of anti-inﬂammatory properties in various Ayurvedic preparations, there is potential for discovering new compounds useful in the management of asthma.References"

It is based on the accumulatedknowledge and understanding of millennia andyet it is very up to date, offering practical and effect-ive treatment for many modern disorders suchasthma, IBS, anxiety and skin disease. Clinical trialsare being carried out at major Ayurvedic institutionsall over the world as the search continues for treat-ments that are safe and effective through reviewsof Eastern as well as Western medicine. Ancientwisdom is constantly being verified by modernresearch. The roots of Ayurveda are lost in the mists of Since then I have continued to study Ayurveda and slowly to incorporate its wisdom into mypractice and now into my writing. Its effect hasbeen a gradual transformation of my life as well asmy herbal practice, that has evolved over the last12–14 years, which is reflected here in my approachto the treatment of children. For the sake of clarityand understanding for readers, I have tried tokeep the Western and Ayurvedic approach separatein treatment advice given in each chapter, althoughin practice my approach is more integrated. The writing of this book is motivated by the growing interest in herbal medicine amongstmainstream and complementary healthcare prac-titioners. By some this interest has even beendescribed as an enormous need for information ina climate of holism, health education and health Introductionvii 442 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 4.

Besides their aetiopathogenesis, the texts describe brieﬂy but vividly the signs, symptoms, and behavioral alterations in different psychiatric diseases and their classiﬁcations. The psychiatric conditions described in original texts may be classiﬁed as follows: 1. Primary psychological conditions caused purely by manasa dosas (i.e., rajas and tamas). An example is the set of manas dosas vikaras7: lust (kama), anger (krodha), greed (lobha), delusion (moha), jealousy (irsya), pride (mana), eurphoria (mada), sorrow (dukha), grief (soka), anxiety (cinta), neurosis (udvega), fear (bhaya), and happiness (harsa). 426 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 62.

If vata were disturbed, the diet would include oils, butter, and sweet food. If kapha were disturbed, the diet would include bitter, sour, vinegary, spicy, dry food. If pitta were disturbed, the diet would include mild tasting food, grains, lentils, and moderate amounts of sweets and oils. Patients are given a restricted diet of small quantities of mung dal (a type of lentil) or yogurt and rice.

It also helps stimulate digestion and reduce gas."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 196","A combination of fennel and chamomile is par- ticularly useful to calm the stomach and to soothea distressed child. When a child is upset or overexcited, the sym- pathetic nervous system causes a rush of adrena-line (epinephrine) and all the resultant physicalchanges that accompany stress or excitement,including the flow of energy away from the digest-ive system. Digestion obviously works betterwhen the child is relaxed and the parasympatheticnervous system comes into play. As a result of thestress, food is not digested well and sits in thestomach, which if it is very tense, can forcibly throwit out. Children are often prone to vomiting beforetests or exams, if they are anxious or unhappy, ifthere is something they “just cannot stomach” orare “sick and tired of”.

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity.

Introduction Coriander was mentioned in Sanskrit texts dating back almost 7000 years ago (Foster 1993) and weknow that at least 3000 years ago it was an import-ant ingredient in cookery and medicines of theancient Egyptians. Coriander has a cooling effect in the body and is specifically recommended to bal-ance Pitta. Internal uses Digestive system Coriander is a good remedy for hot inflammatory conditions, particularly in the digestive tract. It isoften used with cumin and fennel. In India they usefresh coriander leaf in their food, both to prevent and remedy symptoms such as heartburn, indiges-tion, wind, colic, diarrhoea and dysentery. They alsoroast fennel seeds with coriander seeds and a little salt and chew them after eating to combat sleepinessafter a large meal. Perhaps this is why coriander is salt and chew them after eating to combat sleepinessafter a large meal. Perhaps this is why coriander is considered to be nerve and brain strengthening.Coriander enhances appetite and improves digestion and absorption of nutrients, and with its relaxantand anti-inflammatory effect in the gut, helps torelieve spasm, griping, gastritis and nervous dys-pepsia. The seeds are often combined with laxativesto prevent any griping the latter may cause. Respiratory system The seeds can be mixed with turmeric and cumin,and taken in hot teas for colds, flu, coughs andcatarrh to aid the body’s fight against infectionand as a decongestant. Urinary system The cooling effects of coriander make it an excellent remedy for urinary disorders, particularly thosewith hot burning symptoms such as cystitis andurethritis. The diuretic effect of coriander goes some way to explain its cooling and cleansing effect.

While food conversion provides energy,it also requires energy to perform all the essentialbiochemical reactions involved in the process ofdigestion. If the digestive energy is weak or dis-turbed, problems arise, which can cause symptomsinvolving the digestive tract itself such as stomachaches, diarrhoea or constipation, as well as thoseaffecting general health and energy, such as leth-argy, headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate,disturbed sleep and lowered immunity.

InIndia it is held in as high esteem as ginseng inChinese medicine and has recently been referred toas Indian Ginseng. Its Sanskrit name ashwagandhaliterally means “that which has the smell of ahorse”, so named because it is said to give thestrength and vitality of a horse. It is renowned inIndia as the best rejuvenative herb, particularly formen, promoting energy and vitality, and has beenused for centuries for its restorative properties toremedy conditions of weakness and debility.

It is likely that exposure to allergens and development of atopy later in life are responsible for late onset of asthma. The role of viral infections in causation in adults is not clear; they may be a trigger for acute exacerbation. The overall description of the prognosis of asthma in Ayurveda and the current practice appear to be similar.13.8 Management 13.8.1 Ayurvedic Approach Management of asthma in Ayurveda judiciously encompasses herbal and herbomineral drugs in addition to advising a healthy lifestyle and diet that are contrary to the cause of disease and the disease itself. As the pathogenesis of this disorder involves an imbalance between the vata and kapha, the therapy is directed at correcting this imbalance. In addition, there are a few therapies for controlling the acute symptoms. The texts recommend that the patients should be given sudation and steaming therapy 210 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies13.1 Introduction Bronchial asthma is a common global health problem. Individuals of all ages are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and occasionally fatal. The prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide, especially in children.1 Over the past few decades, there have been signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances leading to improved understanding of the disease and better management. However, the current modes of therapy in conventional medicine do not cure the disorder but control the symptomatology. There is a need to explore safe alternative therapies, such as Ayurvedic medicine, so that they can be successfully integrated with conventional therapy to provide maximal beneﬁts to patients.13.2 Deﬁnition Ayurveda: Svasa (increased or difﬁcult breathing, dyspnea) refers to the disorders of the respiratory system. There are ﬁve kinds: ksudraka, tamaka, chchinna, mahan, and urdhava. Of these, tamaka svasa refers to asthma.2–5 214 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies 13.7 Clinical Course and Prognosis According to Ayurveda, of all the signiﬁcant svasa disorders, tamaka svasa (asthma) is yapya (i.e., controllable).1 It is not curable and symptoms are likely to persist. The only exceptions to this may be disease of short duration in strong, healthy, young individuals and if the disease severity is mild. In the past few decades, a lot of research has been conducted to determine the natural history of asthma. Asthma symptoms may disappear in one third to one half of children at puberty.38,39 Even though symptoms may be absent, abnormalities in lung function can be demonstrated. However, symptoms may appear later in adulthood. Nearly two thirds of children continue suffering from the disorder through adolescence and adulthood. Asthma may have onset in adult life.40 The exact proportion of such patients is not known. It is likely that exposure to allergens and development of atopy later in life are 224 Scientiﬁc Basis for Ayurvedic Therapies medications and modern medicine may be able to improve the control of this common respiratory disorder.13.10  Areas of Research  Further research is needed to: 1. Establish efﬁcacy of various Ayurvedic preparations used in asthma by good quality randomized controlled trials. 2. Determine the active principles in various Ayurvedic medications. 3. Evaluate the impact of Ayurvedic medications on the natural history. 4. Evaluate the role of immunomodulator medications available in Ayurveda.13.11  Conclusions The review of literature highlights need for more research in utility of Ayurvedic prepa- rations in bronchial asthma. At present, the medications and the management are not well standardized. As a large number of experimental studies have documented the presence of anti-inﬂammatory properties in various Ayurvedic preparations, there is potential for discovering new compounds useful in the management of asthma.References"

It stimulates digestion and supports gastrointestinal health in children."," Anne McIntyre - Herbal Treatment of Children, p. 196","Cardamom seeds have a warming and invigorating effect throughout the body, beginning as soon asthey reach the stomach. By stimulating Samana Vayu and agni they stimulate the secretion of digestive juices, improve appetite, enhance digestion andabsorption of food, and with their relaxing effecton smooth muscle in the digestive tract they cansettle the stomach, especially when it is affected bystress. They can be used for indigestion, colic,wind, and travel sickness. They actually have abalancing effect in the digestive tract for whilststimulating the flow of digestive juices they cancounteract excess acidity in the stomach. In mod-ern Ayurvedic medicine cardamoms are a popular remedy for nervous digestive upsets in children,and are often combined with fennel. When sim-mered in water for a few minutes and taken as ahot tea, they will relieve colic, wind and indiges-tion, and help to quell nausea and vomiting.

Immune system Research into the mode of action of the immune-stimulating effect of echinacea suggests many mechanisms, including increased phagocytosis ofpathogens by means of macrophage activation(Wildfeuer and Mayerhofer 1994, Barrett 2003).Echinacea has an antibiotic and antifungal effect mediated by immune stimulation, an antiviralaction (Binns et al 2002) and an antiallergenicaction. This means that it can be taken at the firstsigns of sore throats, colds, chest infections, tonsil-litis, and glandular fever as well as for candidaand post viral fatigue syndrome (ME). As a bloodcleanser it will help to clear the skin of infections,and will help to relieve allergies such as urticariaand eczema. It is particularly useful for peoplewhose deficient immune system makes themprone to one infection after another. It is used inGermany along with chemotherapy in treatmentof cancer. Temperature Without doubt the most popular immune- boosting herb in this country today is echinacea.This amazing herb can improve the immune sys-tem in many ways including increasing activity ofT cells, interferon and natural killer cells and rais-ing properdin levels (Kim et al 2002, Barrett 2003).Properdin activates the alternative complementpathway, which is responsible for increasing non-specific host defence mechanisms like neutraliza-tion of viruses, destruction of bacteria andincreasing the migration of white blood cells to theareas of infection. There has been some discussionthat echinacea may work best as a preventative ifit is not taken continuously, but there is little evi-dence to back this up. Echinacea has been shownto be one of the best alternatives to antibiotics, use-ful for all chronic and acute bacterial and viralinfections. For good effect it should be taken every2 hours during acute infections. There is recent evidence that sheds some light Introduction Native Americans used echinacea to treat wounds, burns, abscesses, insect bites, sore throats,toothaches, and joint pains and as an antidote forpoisonous snake bites (Kuhn and Winston 2001).Scientific information on the medicinal benefits ofechinacea comes from two fronts. From 1895 to1930 American doctors demonstrated the immune-enhancing and antimicrobial effects of echinacea, and from German studies over the last 50 yearsmuch of this research has been validated.
